,dating_advice,"So, I've never been in this situation before and I never imagined I could be, so I don't really know how to handle the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My Ex of 6 years and I split up about 3 months ago, we didn't have a huge fight or something, we just agreed that we are not compatible for a life together and stayed friends. About a month ago we started to have sex with each other again because both of us miss that part, but agreed that this is just physical, we both don't want to get back together and we will stop as soon as one of us is about to get into a serious relationship again. Now, I've reconnected with a girl I went to school with and even though we only met up a few times as of right now, I feel like she might be interested in more than just going out for drinks and talking about the old times.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this is far from being anything serious I'm not going to end my FWB-situation with my Ex, but I keep thinking about how and how much I should tell this girl in case it get's more serious and she asks about my past relationships, how long I've been single, when I had sex for the last time etc. Normally I feel like being completly open and honest is the best way to build trust, but I'm worried that she might think I'm not really over my Ex yet and keep her around because I still got feelings for her or that she get's put of because a) it's my Ex and b) we've been together for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

So what would you do?

,dating_advice,"I understand that this is sub for dating advice so I hope it's okay to ask this question even though it's extremely ironic.

Anyway, I remember joining this sub back when I was 19, and now I'm 22. Back then I remember wanting a relationship. I really wanted the love and support of a partner more than anything else. I truly thought that was what would make me happy

But now I'm beginning to have serious thoughts that maybe that's not where my happiness lays.

To further elaborate, lately, in the last few months, I've seen friends and relatives lose their relationships. Some of those relationships were just casual ones, some were a bit more committed with children and engagement rings involved.

To have seen how a break up can have a devastating effect on one... It's terrifying. It's made me realize that while it's true that a relationship can greatly enhance your life, it has the power to shatter you as well. And I'm unsure if I have the strength to allow myself to be that vulnerable to someone.

It's not just the fear of heartbreaks that has turned me off from relationships but also the fact that I'm used to doing things on my own now. Before I thought I was a loser for going to the movies alone or for eating alone at a restaurant but now it feels weird to NOT be alone.

For example, a few weeks ago I invited a close friend,who happens to be of the opposite sex, to hang out and go shopping together and the whole time I felt very awkward. I know that's they're not my significant other nor do I have feelings for them but for a moment I imagined what if this was a date and it made me uncomfortable just thinking about it. I'm so used to shopping by myself that having someone to slow down my pace for and the need to hold a conversation for the entire trip made me feel exhausted in the end.

It's not just that but when I go on actual dates, I no longer feel excitement. I no longer hope for second dates. I no longer desire anyone as a romantic partner.

I think I've realized that I was never meant to be romantically involved with anyone. It just feels very off to me. 

In short, being with someone makes me feel not so much like myself, I refuse to let someone have the ability to hurt me by deciding they no longer wish to be with me, and I no longer desire to even try to find someone.

I'm unsure if this sounds like defeat or maybe me just deciding I want something else for myself in life and knowing my own limitations when it comes to personal relationships.

,dating_advice,"TL;DR : Met at work and became best friends. Fell hopelessly in love and got shot down a while later. Still feel the same way over 5 years later now shes dropping weird ""hints"" that make me question everything.

EDIT: Sorry if this is on the wrong sub reddit. I'm new here!

I was 18 fresh out of high school when I started my first job. A few months later we get a couple of new employees, one of which is a was a dude that became my best friend soon after. One of the other new hires was a girl that I instantly ""Clicked"" with. The three of use started hanging out outside of work pretty much everyday having an amazing summer.

Fast forward a year and I start getting feelings for this girl. I started dropping hints here and there to see some kind of reaction. Eventually I came out and just said it and got shot down. She was fresh out of a relationship and didn't want anything. A few months later my friend, knowing that I had a thing for her a while ago, out of nowhere asked me if he can ask here out. I told him yea sure why not, not realizing that he was being serious. Eventually that lead to a relationship that started the weirdest three years of my life. Since we where all still best friends I watched this all transpire and got resentful towards him and distanced myself.

About another year goes by, we weren't that close anymore until one day I got into a serious accident. Caught some gravel and wrecked my bike into a guard rail. I broke my back and shattered my elbow (I got lucky and made a full recovery with a few metal additions to my arm). Woke up from a short coma to them standing in my hospital room alongside my family. Somehow that drove us back together and we continued our weird friendship for another two years.

This brings me to the present. She broke up with him and a week later he fked her childhood friend. I was left to pick up the pieces. Needless to say I am no longer friends with him for what he did. There she was single for the first time since 17 so she took full advantage of that and caught up for lost time. The usual partying, getting wasted, etc. The last few months she started acting differently towards me. A lot more touchy and affectionate. Always stealing my phone and taking a bunch of selfies of us, changing in front of me, helping her zip up her dress, etc. A few weeks ago we went to the beach with a bunch of my friends and her friends. We ended up cuddling and falling asleep with the only blanked she brought by the fire pit. Some might dismiss this as ""just things you do with your best friend"" but keep in mind this is someone that doesn't really like physical contact with anyone ever.

Now here I am really confused and questioning everything. In love with my best friend for over 5 years and not knowing what to do with myself anymore. I like hanging out with her and I hate it at the same time.

,dating_advice,"I 25/m had a second date with this girl 25/F that I met on Bumble last Saturday and it went fantastically well. 

Originally we had planned to meet at a coffee shop at like 1:30 in the afternoon on Saturday, but then I found out that she was actually planning on cutting a trip to Lansing (like an hour and a half a way from where we live) short just to meet me in time. Once I found out, we rescheduled to meet at a bar later that night instead so that she would have more time in Lansing. I feel like the fact that she was willing to make an hour and a half drive back to see me early was a pretty strong IOI?

We didn't hook up or anything like that after the date but we met at a bar and played pool and hung out and talked for like 3.5 hour straight and it literally felt like I could have talked to her all night. I've never had this good of chemistry with someone who I've met through a dating app. It was awesome.

Afterwards when we were talking in the parking lot she made it clear that she wants to keep seeing me, but unfortunately she is out of town visiting her family through the end of the year. Completely unprompted she said something like ""the timing of all of this is really unfortunate, but I'm not going to be able to see you again until the new year. Now that we know that we live in the same apartment complex this should be alot easier"" (We discovered by complete coincidence that we live in the same apartment complex lol.).

I went home feeling fantastic, and went ahead and texted her the following morning just to make sure that she knew my interests/intentions. I said something along the lines of ""I've never connected this well with someone who I've met through a dating app and definitely want to keep seeing you"". I feel like this was kindof a risky text to send someone, but I didn't get a response until like 9 hours later .... and we've been continuing to text but it feels like I usually reply within in hour and she almost always replies at the end of the day.

Is this something that I should be worried about?

,dating_advice,"Backstory: I dated a guy for about 11 months (this month would have made it a year.) Our relationship was mostly long distance since neither of us had a car and we went to colleges about an hour and a half away from each other. He did come down here to see me one time during a football game but it was a disaster. He showed up an hour late, he acted distant/cold to me, he pretty much ignored me and only talked to his family while we were there. He explained that he didn't let his family know we were dating because he ""doesn't like to share personal info with his family"". (he brought them to the game because his mom wanted to visit since his sister goes to my school)

I broke up with him a few days later. I realized that I didn't want to be treated this way and that I didn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore. 

Anyway, throughout our whole relationship it's almost always been him that showered me with affection via text. He helped me with my anxiety and depression some too. I always feel uncomfortable with the phrase ""I love you"" since I think you should only say it when you're super serious and you really mean it. About 5 months or so into our relationship he started telling me he loved me. I was uncomfortable and I never said it back because I didn't want to lie. I did like him but never really told him I loved him until about the 9-10 month mark on our relationship. After I broke it off I didn't feel sad or heartbroken, just slightly disappointed that it didn't work out. I didn't cry or try to get him to come back or anything.

At this point I honestly considered that maybe I'm not the kind of person who can fall in love. Maybe I'm just meant to be alone.

,dating_advice,"The other night I went to a gay bar and I was having a good time dancing and singing with friends and strangers.

At some point during the night, a man placed his arm around my shoulder and we were singing to whatever song that was being played. It's fun to vibe with people over music so I didn't mind that at all!

I went back to see my friends when it was over. As I walked back the same guy high fived me and later said ""Let me slap your ass!"" I told him I didn't roll that way and he still proceeded to slap my ass. I told him to back off and he just replied back ""I would have just taken it"". Now, maybe I was ""signalling"" to other people that I was gay (I'm not) because I was wearing a pink sweater but that's still no reason to just throw yourself at someone and assume that all your advances will be received well. I wore pink because I like pink.

Later during the night, another song I like was being played and I went back to the stage to dance. This man, once again,  came up to the stage and forcefully tried to dance with me. I shoved him away. He proceeded to try and dance with someone else.

Now, at no point was I scared during the night. I'm a rather fit guy and I'm pretty sure protecting myself against this man would not have been too difficult. I was mostly just annoyed but I probably would have gotten really angry had this man kept on going with his advances.

I hated the ass slap, I hated the fact he forcefully tried to get me to dance with him and I hated his dismissive attitude towards the boundaries I tried to set up. As I went home, I just wondered ""Shit, imagine what women have to go through"". While I only felt a short instance of annoyance and frustration, many ladies have to put up with something like this on a consistent basis and there's easily a huge ordeal of shame, humiliation, fear and anger.

I'm not really a feminist type of person, but after this experience, it really opened up to me to many issues you ladies are facing. I know this guy in my story is probably in the minority, but we still have to do better.

I have done things to women that have been received negatively and that have caused awkward situations in the past and I probably still do to some extent today (although I think I've improved a little, haha). I don't really know how to end this post. Reading signs is difficult. Knowing when something will be received well is almost always a gamble. Some people will be OK with certain things and others may not. I guess my only advice is to think a few more seconds before you act and if someone is not OK with a certain advance do not be dismissive. Learn from them and keep improving.

Edit:  
Wow this blew up. The thread is lock and I think it is maybe for the best. This sparked a lot of conversation and debate and while I think there has been a lot of constructive discussions, there has also been a lot of backlash from many people (and that is also fine and I encourage people to point out the flaws in my ideas or opinions). Perhaps I should have phrased certain things better, as I feel as this thread has been a conduit for people to throw gross generalization about many different groups of people. That was not my intention.

I did not mean to characterize homosexuals as predatory, I did not mean to belittle or dismiss women's experience by saying my experience was more important or traumatic than theirs and ultimately I think consent is just something that everyone needs to work on and talk about more (all genders and orientations).

At the end of the day, this is just a personal experience I have gone through and have felt that I have learned from. I felt that sharing might help some people with their dating lives and just in their general lives overall. I hope it has given you something to reflect about a little more.

I met this girl a year ago, we live in different towns, but we talk a lot. I always had strong feeling for her but she rejected me.

The Sunday of that same weekend I went on a date with a great girl I met online, and I told her about it.
Once the date ended she asked me how it went, and I said great ! She told me she was very happy about it.
I asked her about her day, she told me it was good but at the same time horrible (would not tell me why).
She then added that she was waiting to hear how my day went and that now that she knew she could go to sleep and we left things like that.

The way that conversation went was very out of character for her, and there definitely was something more to it. And because I tend to overanalyze everything she says I am wondering, is it possible that now that I am trying to move on by seeing other people, she starts regretting letting me go ?

&lt;p&gt;The way that conversation went was very out of character for her, and there definitely was something more to it. And because I tend to overanalyze everything she says I am wondering, is it possible that now that I am trying to move on by seeing other people, she starts regretting letting me go ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it all in my mind ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

so last Thursday a friend \[f/27\] and I went to a book store which had an event and she also brought a friend of hers. The conversation with her went really smooth and we instantly had a good conversation and it felt like we could talk for many hours more. So we exchanged numbers and had our 2nd (or first? date) yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

This date was also really good in my opinion. We went for coffee to a private roastery and there was never a time where we didn't have anything to talk about. After like 2 1/2 hours of straight talking I suggested that we could go for a walk as well. However, it was way too cold for that, so we took the train back to central station.

She then asked me for the time and when I told her, she said that she will probably take the train even further to work on stuff for university. I asked her if we're gonna meet again and she said sure.

Also, before the date she texted me a lot, and after the date it was only short messages. Again, as she said she had to do stuff for university, so I get that, but it felt kinda bad for me anyway. It just fuled into my insecuirty, so I'm not sure if she just said that to get out of the date or if she really has to do sth. for university, because she didn't say anything regarding this topic before. Anyway, this doesn't matter really much.

&amp;#x200B;

So after that date, I constantly thought about her and I really liked her. So I thought, tomorrow or wednesday I will ask for another date.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm unsure if I should just ask for another date, or tell her, that I really liked the date, think she's smart, fashionable and attractive and want to know if she thinks the same. I mean, we only had one ""real"" date and the other one wasn't a real date, it was just a spontaneous act. It's just, for me, it was that we instantly hit it off. It felt like we knew each other for a much longer time. Everything was so natural with her. It just felt right.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I just don't want to ""scare"" her off, by saying those things after such a short time and am thinking if I should go for another ""normal"" date or if I should tell her how I feel.

,dating_advice,"Hi everyone, 

First off, I wanna say how much reddit has helped me in general with getting over bad breakups and regaining my confidence and self esteem. Reading other people’s posts and realizing that you’re not alone in your struggles really helps establish a sense of belonging and getting over your own personal hurdles as well. And with t hat, I need your guys’s advice on something. 

A few months ago, I had shattered my phone and I went to the Apple Store to try to replace it. I thought that I had insurance to cover the damage but I didn’t. And this one worker approached to help me and in the end, he basically went through two hours of helping me and essentially replaced my phone for free (he reported there was technical difficulties on my phone) and this saved me $600. In the moment, I couldn’t process how much this worker helped me and I simply said thank you to him, but it honestly meant so much more to me because I was going through a really difficult time, and an extremely bad breakup, and he basically restored my faith in humanity, as dramatic as that sounds. And quite frankly, I thought he was really cute and the fact that he went out of his way to help me so much made me think that maybe he thinks i’m cute too. (Or maybe he’s just doing his job too lol)

There is also a local coffee shop in my city that I always go to for studying or chatting with friends. And in this coffee shop, I have seen the guy who helped me at the Apple Store, and I think he’s so attractive.

Gentlemen, it’s not, and things are a lot simpler.


Just remember a few things and you will be alright:


* When you approach a woman, say what’s really on your mind. Don’t say what you think she wants to hear. This is where many guys blow it. When you say what you think she wants to hear, she can see that. This will come off weak in her eyes because you’re not being authentic. Doesn’t matter what you say, even if it’s “you’re sexy as hell!”. Women want to be noticed and adored but they want you to be strong and direct.

* Watch for signs of interest. Playing with hair, exposing her neck, showing interest in you, facing you with her body are all good signs. Also, don’t tell her your name. After a small conversation ask her name and wait, if she doesn’t ask your name, stop wasting your time. She’s not interested.

* It’s always better set a date on the spot instead of on the phone. If you’re just starting out, there’s a good chance you will say something stupid on the phone and blow it. Just ask her “when are you free to go out?”

* Go out one time a week until she starts reaching out. When she does, set a date and get off the phone.

* Don’t spend your money or talk about your achievements. It won’t make you look better. Take her out to inexpensive places until she suggests to be your girlfriend, which she will, eventually, if you know what you’re doing.",t2_4uetcgry,False,,0,False,How to approach a woman,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e86s4n,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575905392.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many guys over complicate things, work on their pick up lines, try to “trick” women, play games etc. thinking this is the way to women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you approach a woman, say what’s really on your mind. Don’t say what you think she wants to hear. This is where many guys blow it. When you say what you think she wants to hear, she can see that. This will come off weak in her eyes because you’re not being authentic. Doesn’t matter what you say, even if it’s “you’re sexy as hell!”. Women want to be noticed and adored but they want you to be strong and direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch for signs of interest. Playing with hair, exposing her neck, showing interest in you, facing you with her body are all good signs. Also, don’t tell her your name. After a small conversation ask her name and wait, if she doesn’t ask your name, stop wasting your time. She’s not interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s always better set a date on the spot instead of on the phone. If you’re just starting out, there’s a good chance you will say something stupid on the phone and blow it. Just ask her “when are you free to go out?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go out one time a week until she starts reaching out. When she does, set a date and get off the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t spend your money or talk about your achievements. It won’t make you look better. Take her out to inexpensive places until she suggests to be your girlfriend, which she will, eventually, if you know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Note: Asking for advice / also kind of a vent 

So me (19M) and this girl (19F) met off tinder,  and we hit it off in chat immediately.  She deleted tinder shortly after. Unfortunately we go to different schools, so theyres a distance barrier between us. After a week of chatting, I invited her out and we met. I thought it went pretty well. But for the next two weeks, our schedules never really lined up. Were both really busy weekdays so we can only meet on weekends. Now its been about a month since we went on the first date (red flag, ik).

But she still initiates conversation. She says good morning and good night to me. I find it really cute. Its mostly about our lives, and nothing really sexual. She seems like a really shy and introverted girl so I dont think shes into text flirting, unless I was shawn mendes or something. Anyways, ive asked her to hang out 3 times, the first two times her excuses seemed legit and she offered to reschdule, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but when I asked her yesterday, she simply replied im not sure yet, its so goddamn cold (it is 5 degrees where we live) and I hate taking the bus alone.

Just a lazy blow off if ive ever seen one. And then she steered the conversation to something else. I really want to call her out on it, but that would just get me no where, so would going no contact and moving on be the best course of action?

Keep contacting slowly and wait for her to ask me? Its the end of the semester at my school so I don't really have any options that I can just move on to, and especially theres a one month holiday. I also kinda caught feelings for her so its really just a bummer that I might have to cut this off.

I don't want to make this post about that but it might provide some perspective. I am in therapy and have made some effort to become more attractive, most noticeably by losing weight.

,dating_advice,"I hate asking for advice, but I’d kill for objective input.

I (m21) reached out to a girl (f20) on social media when I realized we had a ton of close, mutual friends. I hate following/having followers who I don’t personally know, so I really just wanted to have a genuine human interaction with this person, just to do it. It wasn’t a date. She agreed to meet me at our university and we sat and talked for almost three hours. We talked about our families, our friends, faith, ideas, etc. and it was super pleasant. We have differences, we didn’t agree on everything, but when I walked away from that I was confident I had just met one of the most incredible people. And I didn’t know what to do with that feeling, but I knew I wanted to learn more about her.

I reached out a couple days later and we agreed to meet up again. This time she was crunched for time, so we only talked for 45 mins. I walked away from that confident that I was interested in dating this person.

More time passed, I got busy, but still reached out again to meet at a coffee shop just to talk. Then she questioned my intentions, and rightfully so. I wasn’t 100% sure yet if I wanted to ask her out sooner or later, and she was concerned that she might be feeding my expectations when we weren’t on the same page. You see, she had just in recent months returned from a life-changing trip abroad, and made it know that for spiritual reasons she was taking at least the rest of the year to process her experiences without the distractions of dating someone. Sharing the same faith as her, I highly respected that sentiment and let her know that while I saw potential in dating her down the line I didn’t want her to feel like I was pressuring her into something she wasn’t ready for. She said she was still available to be friends; so we met for coffee.

After that meeting I chose to back off for awhile. I realized how fast I was falling and how I wanted this woman to be a part of my life (she might be the most amazing person I’ve met), but I also wanted to respect her time apart from dating and relationships. I know she was being honest about that commitment, it wasn’t exclusive to me. But in the next month I had no peace about my decision. I missed her terribly. I know we have a lot to offer each other, and our lives are headed in a similar direction. I was willing to be patient and play a long-game for her. I’ve never met someone so worth that.

Last night I hit up her DM for the first time in awhile about a shared interest. I know how being in her phone constantly can make a guy look desperate, and I hadn’t texted in quite awhile because I didn’t want to indulge myself in feeding my attraction to her while she’s not trying to indulge me. She replied with enthusiasm, but then tagged on the end that she’s “glad we’re friends.” I’ve heard that enough times to know exactly what it means. She sounds like she’s letting me know not to get my hopes up, but I can’t imagine why.

My conversations with this girl were always edifying and gratifying, but I’m not perfect. I have a lot on my plate always, I’m very ambitious and motivated (I work with high school students, attend college, and own a small videography business) but I’ve always struggled to connect with women. I’m honest but not naturally funny, well-kept and attractive but not very smooth. I’m confident in who I am, but have been rejected so many times by so many women I get nervous that I’m doing something wrong. I mention this to clarify that while I’ve had a good connection with this girl (who goes in for seconds after a bad three-hour conversation?) I don’t think I’m naturally charming.

Still I don’t see why she would feel the need to discourage me from even having interest in her at this point. Could she really feel so sure that I’m not boyfriend potential? My fear is that, in choosing to give her space and not be very forward about my feelings for her, I came across as flaky, inconsistent, or disinterested. I feel like I’ve somehow blown my shot before I ever took it, and even after she becomes open to a relationship I’ll have been cemented in her mind as strictly causal friend material.

Is there any hope that I might change her mind, or find a way to let her know where I really am? I feel like in finding this person I’ve stumbled upon something very valuable and very rare, and I’d hate to have to throw my hands up and walk away without knowing how or why I got to that point. Anything could help.

TL;DR:

I met an amazing girl and I want to date her, but she’s not ready for a relationship with anyone and it seems the timing is pushing her to lock me in as strictly a friend. Can this be avoided?

,dating_advice,"I know things like this are probably extremely common so I apologize in advance if this is extremely repetitive! 

I'm a 23M and I think the person in question is somewhere near my age, maybe a bit older.

Three or four months ago I ducked into a Starbucks for a drink. I placed my order and gave her my name and the girl behind the counter made a comment about my name and we had a very brief conversation about it, which wasn't uncommon as I have a highly uncommon name that isn't spelled normally. We talked some more about podcasts (I was wearing a shirt with my favorite podcast on the front) and then I went on my way. She was friendly, but I didn't think anything of it. She was just being nice and conversational, doing her job, I figured.

Last week I ducked in for the first time since then (again, three or four months ago) and the same barista was working. She looked at me, recognized me and said ""Oh hi, you're [my name], right?"" Or something along those lines. She was pretty friendly and we had another brief conversation and that was that. Again, my name is weird so I didn't think it was unusual that she would remember or that there was anything more to it.

Cut to last night. I was on my way somewhere else and decided to pop in on the way for a drink once again. She was working. I approached the counter and she kind of looked at me and very casually said, ""Hey [my name]!"" I placed my order and she asked me how I was doing. I told her I was doing well and that I was on my way to a friends to play some D&amp;D. She got kind of elated and mentioned that she also plays and we talked about it for a little bit. As I was leaving she said that ""It would be cool to talk more about it,"" and I was kind of just like ""Yeah, I would like that!""

Just that last remark at the end about wanting to talk more and stuff has kind of had me wondering since then if that was a hint or an invitation of some kind? I dunno man. It feels silly how much I've been mulling it over. Which is why I'm here!

,dating_advice,"I went to a club on Friday night and I met a guy there by accident. We danced for a bit but he ended up sticking with me and my friends. 

He’s 25M and of course I find everything about him incredibly attractive. He was complimenting me, calling me beautiful, etc. When we walked between rooms I’d hold his hand. He was really affectionate and kept rubbing my hair, my face, etc. The only problem was, I had a boyfriend at the time. And even though we weren’t doing great (we broke up yesterday), I’m still not a cheater, so I kept my distance a little, didn’t persistently dance with him alone and stuff. 

We went into the back garden that the club with my friends and he had a cigarette and sat next to me. We were talking and we couldn’t stop laughing and smiling. He told me where he was from, work, etc. I said he was incredibly handsome as well. He then stopped midway conversation and said “I think you should kiss me”. I laughed and said I couldn’t do that because I’ve got a boyfriend. He looked a little disappointed, but we carried on our conversation for a bit before we all got up and went back inside. 

He still stayed with me and my friends, was still affectionate and calling me beautiful or gorgeous every now and again. There were a couple times were he leaned in to kiss me and I’d move away, laugh and say “I can’t do that”. Either way, we stayed together with my friends the whole night. The club finished at 6 and we all left together. 

I needed to get the train back, which was about 20 minutes. He lived in the area and only needed to walk back home. He walked me and my friends to the train station and we all stood and spoke for a bit. He went to hug me and say like “I’ll see you” but I stopped him and asked if he has Instagram. He said yes and we exchanged right there and then and we accepted each other in front of each other. He briefly went through my profile, made a joke and picked a picture of me and said “can I meet her” and I laughed and said “I’m right here!”. I mentioned that I was tired and couldn’t be bothered to travel back home and he said “my apartment is two minutes away”. I slapped his arm and said “who do you think I am” and we both laughed. 

The next thing I did was definitely out of character, but I really liked him. I asked if he wanted to drop me off at my station. He asked how long it was and I said about 20 minutes and he can get on the same line back home. He came with me and my friends and I sat on one of those seats that are high up and you just sort of rest your butt on it but you’re still technically standing. He stood in front of me and we spoke a little, but we were both quite tired. 

Both of my friends got off before me, so it was just me and him. There were moments where he would just look into my eyes and we’d just...stare, but not in a creepy way, but in an intense way. I’d start to get nervous and look in another direction, but we’d always end up looking at each other again. 

We spoke a little more and I got off at my stop and I told him to hang on and lemme sit down while I put my shoes back on. He sat next to me and put his arm around me. I asked him what he was doing and he said “I’m putting my arm around you” and I laughed and said “no” because I’m still fully aware I have a boyfriend. I made a joke and I said “you’re too confident for your own good” and “I don’t think you’d be able to handle me”. All said within jest, nothing aggressive and he just laughed really hard. 

We got up and I said I’d wait with him while his train came on the opposite platform. It was only 5 minutes, but of course we spoke some more and his train came. We hugged each other and as we pulled away he went in to kiss me again. Again, I said no and he looked a bit disappointed. I don’t actually remember what was said after that, but I think we made a joke of some sort and we went on our way. 

I got home at around 7am and of course I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I didn’t do anything and I went to sleep. Unfortunately, work called and I had to be at work for 2:30 instead of 4:30 so I woke up at 10:30 and couldn’t get back to sleep. I was going through my camera roll and I see a video of me, him and my friend dancing. I wasn’t trying to start any sort of conversation and was well aware that he’d probably be sleeping, but I dmed him the video on Instagram and said “I found a video of us”. I keep checking my phone all day and it doesn’t say he’s active or anything, and this is around 7pm. I message again just in case and I said “you sleep a lot!” And left it at that. Hours go by and at around 11pm or so, I’ve seen that he’s online but he hasn’t read any of my messages. I feel quite disappointed, but I message “are you okay?” And of course, get nothing, so I leave it. 

I’m all very disappointed and actually quite upset. I finished work at 2am and I was getting a paid cab home. I sent a final message that was along the lines of “I don’t know if I’ve done something wrong or gave you the wrong signal but I hope you’re okay” something like that. I ended up getting so embarrassed with myself sending so many messages that I deleted the conversation, so I don’t actually know whether he’s read it or not by now. He still follows me, but I’ve posted a few Instagram stories and he hasn’t seen any. It’s clear he’s not very active on Instagram as he hasn’t got any pictures and only follows 23 people. It has his name and job in his bio, both of which I remember from when he told me. 

I obviously understand that he’s 25 and he’s most likely working and living his life, but it seemed like he was way too affectionate with me to just want to be with me for the night. It seemed quite wholesome and like he genuinely liked me. He didn’t grab me, force himself on me or anything like that. But that could just be how he rolls and that’s how he gets girls if he wants to. 

But I have a feeling that I also put him off by saying that I’ve got a boyfriend so many times, but I did also try to show him that I really liked him, in the boundaries that I could. He may just be quite disappointed because I did show interest but also kept saying I had a boyfriend. Believe me, I would really love to kiss him now if he ever asked again!

I really didn’t think he’d not talk to me. I really wanted to meet up asap and ask him what he’s looking for. If he wanted something casual, no strings attached then I’d be content and say that’s not for me and go about my life. But if there was relationship potential, then I’d know where I stand. But there is no answer anywhere or anything like that. 

The particular club we went to was themed and it does the theme every month. I was thinking that when the next dates come out for the club, I was gonna buy tickets and message him casually and say something like “Hey, have you seen the new dates for *club*? I just bought my ticket, are you gonna go?” To try and possibly break the ice. I would be quite disappointed if he didn’t read or reply at all, but then I suppose I’d get my answer. But a flat mate I was talking to yesterday said to wait a week and then message him casually and see if it goes anywhere. The flat mate’s male friend said that guys nowadays are just insanely slow at replying, even with girls they like. 

So I’m not really sure where I stand! I don’t want to just give it up, but I know there will be plenty of people that’ll say “it was a club, what did you expect” but I’d prefer proper answers and not those ones.

&lt;p&gt;He still stayed with me and my friends, was still affectionate and calling me beautiful or gorgeous every now and again. There were a couple times were he leaned in to kiss me and I’d move away, laugh and say “I can’t do that”. Either way, we stayed together with my friends the whole night. The club finished at 6 and we all left together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to get the train back, which was about 20 minutes. He lived in the area and only needed to walk back home. He walked me and my friends to the train station and we all stood and spoke for a bit. He went to hug me and say like “I’ll see you” but I stopped him and asked if he has Instagram. He said yes and we exchanged right there and then and we accepted each other in front of each other. He briefly went through my profile, made a joke and picked a picture of me and said “can I meet her” and I laughed and said “I’m right here!”. I mentioned that I was tired and couldn’t be bothered to travel back home and he said “my apartment is two minutes away”. I slapped his arm and said “who do you think I am” and we both laughed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I did was definitely out of character, but I really liked him. I asked if he wanted to drop me off at my station. He asked how long it was and I said about 20 minutes and he can get on the same line back home. He came with me and my friends and I sat on one of those seats that are high up and you just sort of rest your butt on it but you’re still technically standing. He stood in front of me and we spoke a little, but we were both quite tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of my friends got off before me, so it was just me and him. There were moments where he would just look into my eyes and we’d just...stare, but not in a creepy way, but in an intense way. I’d start to get nervous and look in another direction, but we’d always end up looking at each other again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke a little more and I got off at my stop and I told him to hang on and lemme sit down while I put my shoes back on. He sat next to me and put his arm around me. I asked him what he was doing and he said “I’m putting my arm around you” and I laughed and said “no” because I’m still fully aware I have a boyfriend. I made a joke and I said “you’re too confident for your own good” and “I don’t think you’d be able to handle me”. All said within jest, nothing aggressive and he just laughed really hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up and I said I’d wait with him while his train came on the opposite platform. It was only 5 minutes, but of course we spoke some more and his train came. We hugged each other and as we pulled away he went in to kiss me again. Again, I said no and he looked a bit disappointed. I don’t actually remember what was said after that, but I think we made a joke of some sort and we went on our way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home at around 7am and of course I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I didn’t do anything and I went to sleep. Unfortunately, work called and I had to be at work for 2:30 instead of 4:30 so I woke up at 10:30 and couldn’t get back to sleep. I was going through my camera roll and I see a video of me, him and my friend dancing. I wasn’t trying to start any sort of conversation and was well aware that he’d probably be sleeping, but I dmed him the video on Instagram and said “I found a video of us”. I keep checking my phone all day and it doesn’t say he’s active or anything, and this is around 7pm. I message again just in case and I said “you sleep a lot!” And left it at that. Hours go by and at around 11pm or so, I’ve seen that he’s online but he hasn’t read any of my messages. I feel quite disappointed, but I message “are you okay?” And of course, get nothing, so I leave it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all very disappointed and actually quite upset. I finished work at 2am and I was getting a paid cab home. I sent a final message that was along the lines of “I don’t know if I’ve done something wrong or gave you the wrong signal but I hope you’re okay” something like that. I ended up getting so embarrassed with myself sending so many messages that I deleted the conversation, so I don’t actually know whether he’s read it or not by now. He still follows me, but I’ve posted a few Instagram stories and he hasn’t seen any. It’s clear he’s not very active on Instagram as he hasn’t got any pictures and only follows 23 people. It has his name and job in his bio, both of which I remember from when he told me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I obviously understand that he’s 25 and he’s most likely working and living his life, but it seemed like he was way too affectionate with me to just want to be with me for the night. It seemed quite wholesome and like he genuinely liked me. He didn’t grab me, force himself on me or anything like that. But that could just be how he rolls and that’s how he gets girls if he wants to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have a feeling that I also put him off by saying that I’ve got a boyfriend so many times, but I did also try to show him that I really liked him, in the boundaries that I could. He may just be quite disappointed because I did show interest but also kept saying I had a boyfriend. Believe me, I would really love to kiss him now if he ever asked again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t think he’d not talk to me. I really wanted to meet up asap and ask him what he’s looking for. If he wanted something casual, no strings attached then I’d be content and say that’s not for me and go about my life. But if there was relationship potential, then I’d know where I stand. But there is no answer anywhere or anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular club we went to was themed and it does the theme every month. I was thinking that when the next dates come out for the club, I was gonna buy tickets and message him casually and say something like “Hey, have you seen the new dates for &lt;em&gt;club&lt;/em&gt;? I just bought my ticket, are you gonna go?” To try and possibly break the ice. I would be quite disappointed if he didn’t read or reply at all, but then I suppose I’d get my answer. But a flat mate I was talking to yesterday said to wait a week and then message him casually and see if it goes anywhere. The flat mate’s male friend said that guys nowadays are just insanely slow at replying, even with girls they like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m not really sure where I stand! I don’t want to just give it up, but I know there will be plenty of people that’ll say “it was a club, what did you expect” but I’d prefer proper answers and not those ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read, I really appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of pulling the trigger on the date by suggesting a time for meeting up and a place for drinks or whatever, I just say ""cool, see you around"" and parted ways. 

On Friday, a day before we were supposedly meant to meet up, I text her asking what she´s doing etc. in an effort to establish contact. It was typical dogshit-dialogue which was headed nowhere, and after a short while she took progressively longer to answer the texts (8 hours to 12 hours to a whole day). 

Instead of shrugging it off and just calling her on Saturday, I waited for her to respond to my latest text she hadn´t responded to yet, so I chose not to call her until then. On Monday she gave some weak reply, and so I just thought whatever, I lost the ball. 

Then on the following Friday I called her but she didn´t answer. That was over two weeks ago.

&lt;p&gt;So, back to the guy I’ve been talking to. We started talking again recently, and we’ve joked about if I went to the country he’s deployed to/if he came back home for a bit. But it’s all been joking “if only”s. Then tonight he said he had news for me, and asked me “what would happen if I was (hypothetically) there?”, and tells me he’s planning a trip back home in the coming months. I really don’t know what to tell him. When I really look at it he’s still basically a stranger to me, I’ve never met him and I can’t say I have feelings for him. I know what he’s asking is if we would have sex, but I’ve never told him about my assault and I don’t want to, again I don’t really know him or consider anything serious between us, I know it’s kind of awful but he’s sort of just been a nice person to fall back on and talk to if I’m feeling lonely. I feel bad just leaving him hanging, but I just don’t know what to say. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

What is semi’ish. I do like her don’t get me wrong but do I pursue her even though her ex isn’t but is still in the picture?

,dating_advice,"TLDR : Will they, won’t they? 
Dating, not dating, dating again, not...

I’ve (F20) been dating this guy (19) for about a year. We met at work. He is such a good guy; he is caring, smart and looks SO confident and a bit shy, which makes him extremely sweet. 
We had a „break“. It wasn’t really a break, more like an end, but I had hope, because it didn’t make sense why he would break things off. Everything was going great. He said it wouldn’t work between us, he wasn’t ready for a relationship and he didn’t have time for one. He was very nice about all this. We didn’t fight, like i said: everything was perfect. This was November to March.

Two months later i got used to the idea that we weren’t going to be together again, but I’m not gonna lie, I still had a tiny bit of hope left.
He went on holiday for about a month. During that time I sent a snap from an event and sent it to him too (wasn’t expecting an answer). We started texting again since. I was also away for a week and he kept asking how it was and so. When he got back i asked him out. It didn’t go according to plan. It was raining on that day and he invited me over to have coffee . We had a moment and started dating again. July-November

I broke things off the second time, because i wanted to spend more time together to get an idea of how it would be (this kinda sounds silly) if we were to be in a relationship. Again, he said he still isn’t ready for one and he still has to figure out his future.  He also told me to not hope for anything because it won’t happen. 

We decided to stay friends. It was a bit awkward at first. 
The thing is, I am confused. When we’re at work he is being flirty and is CHECKING ME OUT and biting his lip (not like the first time). I try to ignore him, but when I glance over he has a smirk on his face. ugh!

The awkwardness went away, he seems more relaxed not being under the pressure of a relationship/dating. Could he be afraid of one? He was in a relationship before, but it didn’t last long. I have never been in one. 
I’m thinking if I were to be in one with him we can make our own rules and define ourselves what a relationship means.

I can’t twist the signs to leave it like he said. From him it doesn’t look like it and it feels like he doesn’t care how he acts, because she knows nothing will happen so he’s just having fun flirting(overthinking again)

He has a cousin (18f) who lives a few hours from us but might be going to college near me next year. We have a group chat between us 3 + another friend and we FaceTime and just help each other out with literally anything, including dating. She asks for our perspective a lot and we ask her for hers. 

Basically I’ve developed a crush on her and I really like her. In the past she’s said stuff in the chat like “where can I find a guy like you” and “your so hot”. I’ve said some similar stuff to her but only when she asks for advice about guys and I use things like that to tell her why would a guy not like her (and to put it out there that I think she’s hot). 

I’m just really stuck rn because I really like her, we are just so compatible and sit on FaceTime for hours talking sometimes. My other best friend in the group chat always makes joke that we should date next year.

He has a cousin (18f) who lives a few hours from us but might be going to college near me next year. We have a group chat between us 3 + another friend and we FaceTime and just help each other out with literally anything, including dating. She asks for our perspective a lot and we ask her for hers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I’ve developed a crush on her and I really like her. In the past she’s said stuff in the chat like “where can I find a guy like you” and “your so hot”. I’ve said some similar stuff to her but only when she asks for advice about guys and I use things like that to tell her why would a guy not like her (and to put it out there that I think she’s hot). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just really stuck rn because I really like her, we are just so compatible and sit on FaceTime for hours talking sometimes. My other best friend in the group chat always makes joke that we should date next year.

,dating_advice,"Hey everyone, to preface a bit I'm 24 M with very little dating experience. I had my first relationship in the begining of 2019 and it only lasted a few months.

I started a new job back in August. The past month I've really started talking to a certain coworker. It was originally mainly about podcasts and the such. Good conversation but nothing too serious. Our work uses IM to communicate a lot so it's been pretty easy to do so while still getting work done.

The past two weeks we have been really upping how much we talk with one another. A few days ago I brought up a local poolhall/bar we both knew about. I mentioned that we should go sometime, which she agreed to! 

We went after work to the bar and played very little pool. We honestly just talked the whole, which was great. Even after the bar closed we probably continued talking for 20+mins outside. We both mentioned we should probably go but then struck up more conversation. From what I've gathered she doesn't really do much after work with anyone, so I took her hanging out with me after work as a good sign.

We didn't flirt really, just talked. Made plenty of eye contact for what it's worth. I never brought up it even being possibly a date. It wasn't really my intention at the time either. I now know id like to explore that possibility.

She even brought up hanging out again whenever I wanted, including other places to go

Is there a good way to transition from a 'hang-out' to a date? Given our work schedules we'd really only be able to do dates after work, which is midnight. Obviously asking her on a date would be the most direct approach but I'm curious if I should hang out with her a few more times before asking. I don't buy into the friend zone crap but I don't want to possibly delay ant chance

Thanks for reading, id love some perspective!

,dating_advice,"I messed up with the girl I like and am unsure on what to do now

So a little backstory, I met this girl through sports, my friend told me that she thought I was cute and stuff. At first I didn’t really mind, but then I started talking to her and started to actually like her. My friend started telling me stuff that she would say about me stuff like” he’s so cute “ etc.
    
We would flirt and stuff, at one point my friend told me that she wanted me to ask her out and stuff. I said “okay” but waited it out a bit then one day we were hanging out, I was letting her curl my hair and I heard her mumble “ I wanna be your girlfriend”.

   
  At first I wasn’t sure what she said so I said “ what?” She replies with “what” . She look around then at her friend embarrassed, the moment passed and we continued to do what we were doing. 
A day later I call her and wanted to talk about what she said when she was curling my hair.

 After 2 hours of talking she finally confirms that’s what she said. (Right around this moment is where I fuck up and say “oh really I didn’t know that”. Jokingly, my original plan was to say something like “well let’s make that happen”)


So after that we talked for a little bit and  we say our goodbyes and stuff. I wasn’t sure if we were dating or whatever. (Keep in mind this is middle school so dating is different )
  So I text her and stuff and ask her if I ever brought up something about a boyfriend. I end up telling her I wanted to be her boyfriend. She replies with the same thing I did. “ oh really I didn’t know that”. I go along with it and after that it became awkward. She didn’t give me an answer just like how I forgot to do.
      It was quiet and I said “sooo” she replied with “what”. After that someone walked in and I said hold on and hung up. I texted her saying I was gonna work on homework, later I chat with her like as if nothing happened, I tell her goodnight and I’ll see her at school.


  So I’m left wondering “ are we dating now?” Or “should I talk to her about it tommorow”. Originally I was just gonna go see her tommorow and see what happens.

What should I do?

Looking back at it, I really regret not doing something about, as I actually really liked her.

,dating_advice,"I was talking to a friend and he asked me what I said to girls when I approach them. 
Keep in mind, I'm no lady killer. Average is being generous, lol. 
But I tried to see if there was some patten in my few successful interactions. 

Nope. 

One girl was playing flappy Bird on a train and we talked about that. 

One girl was a classmate that I saw in the lunch room. 

One girl I didn't talk to much, but I knew I liked her and she was convinced no one would ask her to the prom, so I said ""aha!""

The only pattern is that these girls happened to be interested. 
If a girl likes you, any dumb thing you say will be fine. 
You can studder and be nervous and she won't give a fuck. 
If a girl DOESN'T like you, no magic words are going to change her mind. 
The girl playing flappy bird could've just ignored me or given me a cold answer. But she sort of volunteered extra info: ""This game is so weird.""

Internally I was like ""Aha! She isn't annoyed by me!""

So strike up a conversation the way you'd talk to someone you're not trying to fuck. 
Then ask them out, but have an exit plan in case she says no. 

If you have trouble, practice on people you're not trying to fuck. Then apply what you learned to people you're trying to fuck. 
Then get to know them as a person you thirsty motherfucker.

,dating_advice,"I (29 f)just started dating someone (32 m)new. It’s been about a month and we really like each other (at least I think we do). We’ve met each other’s friends and I met his parents, we agreed we aren’t seeing other people but we haven’t labeled it yet. That’s perfectly fine with me.

He has a really crazy busy job that definitely takes up a lot of his time but he’s always been good at communicating. The only issue really has been that I feel like I’m mostly the one whose waiting around to hear from him and starting the conversations. That is until this weekend...

I was out of town visiting my parents and everything between me and the guy were fine but Sunday he didn’t answer me for almost the entire day. When he finally did he said he has been napping. I choose to believe him because he hasn’t ever given me a reason not to believe him before. We spoke on the phone and everything seemed fine. He said he would pick me up from the airport today and that I should call him before I go to bed.

So I call him and he doesn’t answer which is normal but he usually calls me back within a half hour. He never called me back or answered my text sending him my flight information. I couldn’t sleep all night. 

Now I doubt he’s picking me up and I don’t know how to handle it. This is the first guy in two years that I’ve felt comfortable with and I feel like the whole thing is slipping away. 

If he does pick me up I need to have a conversation with him about better communication but I don’t know how to do that without sounding like I’m attacking him.

So I guess I’m looking for advice on handling the situation both how to not get so upset and how to speak to him about it.

In fact we were a great match, compatibility wise so much better than the guy I was heartbroken over, we have a lot of things in common, he was equally excited at first and we ran sort of a loose online thing for 2 months. I am very glad to have met him since he could entirely wipe out my pain of the first guy. We have never met in person though but it's probably better since his interest isn't that great anymore. I don't need another heartbreak and yes if we would ever meet we would end up sleeping with each other. 

All in all I have had around 20 dates, 1500 matches and probably 15 000 estimated swipes and all what I came up with were these two guys.

,dating_advice,"I’m a 23(F) and met a 24(M) who I can tell REALLY likes me and I REALLY like him back! We’ve already gone out on 3 dates within the past week and I can already tell that we have a genuine connection. But in the past, whenever I have sex with a guy outside of a relationship, he slowly loses interest or only hits me up for sex. I can recall one instance where I had sex with a guy on our second date and he said “I wish we hadn’t done that, we were taking things slow.” and I never heard from him again and it really hurt my feelings. So I vowed from then on not to have sex again until I was in a committed relationship. Finally, with my ex, I told him about my little rule, he was totally okay with it, but when we waited until being in a relationship to have sex, we ended up being EXTREMELY incompatible sexually. While I have a very high sex drive, am a bit kinky, and prefer having sex multiple times a week, he could barely get it up, had a very low sex drive, the sex was awful, and we barely ever had sex. This actually is what broke us up and caused the majority of our problems in the relationship, among other things.  

Now, fast forward to today, with my current guy I have no doubt in my mind that he really cares about me and isn’t trying to just get in my pants (and he made this very clear - This was after he invited me over to his house after dinner on our third date and I told him that I prefer to wait for intimacy, and he was totally okay with it.) I didn’t say no because I didn’t want to have sex with him, because I really do! It’s just that I don’t want him to lose interest in me or stop putting in the effort to get to know me, just because we had sex.

I’ve noticed a few things about some things he says that I just do not like, but I can’t tell if they’re red flags or just him being mindless &amp; not thinking before he speaks. A few examples:

-The other day I asked if he has dated/would date a bigger girl, &amp; he responded by calling fat people sloppy &amp; saying they don’t take care of themselves, which doesn’t line up with “active” lifestyle
- He constantly makes fun of my big granny glasses. I know they’re really goofy but I have a strong prescription &amp; I just haven’t thought to get contacts. Anytime I wear them he makes a point to ask me to take them off, that I’m prettier without them, saying I need new glasses/contacts, etc 
- After asking me advice about his financial situation- hes a musician with disposable income, but can’t afford rent really anymore (esp since he’s rarely there AND his van just crapped out on him so he’ll have to shell out for a new car) so I suggested he toss his Soho house (bougie art club, he only uses the gym + sauna) membership for a year or 2 &amp; maybe find a cheaper apt. He proceeded to tell me those aren’t options &amp; that I don’t understand because I don’t have any money.
- A friend of mine, who is admittedly a little annoying, was over &amp; the 2 of us were talking while Mike &amp; my roommate (his friend) were dicking around in the dining room. My friend (Asian + indigenous) &amp; I (Black + native) ended up having a convo about race &amp; the topic of colonization &amp; White people came up &amp; Mike says, condescendingly, “let’s turn this WAY up.” I assume wanting to drown us out. 
-After spending 2 hours cooking dinner for us, &amp; setting up my projector for us to watch a movie he started it without me well before I was done cooking. Once I was done cooking the movie was over in 15-20 min. He was visibly tired &amp; started falling asleep on the couch. I started putting the projector + screen away, then proceeded to start to clean up the kitchen. He then said to me “Do you ever stop working for 1 minute?” Mind you he didn’t help me cook dinner, didn’t even chop an onion. And he didn’t help me clean anything up, in addition to leaving beer + his half eaten food in a bowl on the floor.

- he’s also very bad at remembering (or caring?) to use my enby friends’ correct pronouns

Hey guys, so recently things have  fallen out with my girlfriend of 2 years. It's gotten rougher and  rougher as we fight alot more than usual. At this one point not too long  ago, I asked for a break and she agreed. She said I could do whatever I  want and there were no rules, during that break, I went on a dating app  and found this other girl who happens to be in my college program and I  see her almost everyday. Along with my girlfriend and I, we all live  around the college area in different hostels (I live with my  girlfriend).

Recently things have  gotten better with my girlfriend but this girl that I met on the dating  app, I ended up chatting with her everyday and it's almost always  chatting flirtatiously as this girl that I met on that app is somewhat  into me and I sorta like talking to her because she's really good  looking and she thinks very highly of me. Something that my girlfriend  hasn't done in so long. I enjoy talking to this dating app girl because  it's bringing up this happy feeling I haven't had in years and now that  my girlfriend has gone back to her state for the semester break while  mine only ends a few weeks later. I've been chatting with that girl till  the point she wants to come give me hugs and go watch a movie.

However,  the dating app girl doesn't know I have a girlfriend and I still really  love my girlfriend and I don't think this is something I should do and  I'm kinda worried if I go eat around the area with my girlfriend, I'll  run into her. What's the best thing I can do at this moment that doesn't  involve letting my girlfriend know about this and to minimize as much  damage as possible among these two girls?

,dating_advice,"I (20F) went with my friend a couple weeks ago to a gathering with a friend of hers and his roommates. We drank a lot, and two of the roommate were flirting with me a little. One of them went to bed after a lull in the party games, and then later in the night we all ended up dancing like idiots in the middle of the floor. It was some of the most fun I’ve had in awhile, I haven’t felt so genuinely carefree and happy and I didn’t realize it until that night.

Anyway, the second guy that didn’t go to bed took my hand and spun me around, danced with me, and was incredibly sweet. I didn’t think he was my type physically, but he was so kind and funny that I turned a bit. He got my Snapchat while I was drinking, and sent me a video of the night, but I never responded.

Fast forward to two weeks later, and it suddenly dawns on me that I have a crush on the dancing boy. He picked my friend, her friend that’s his roommate, and I up from the library the other day, and I flirted minimally. The problem is that it’s finals week, so everyone’s going home for the holidays, and my friend won’t be here next semester. I don’t know how to engage him and I don’t know any of these guys well enough to invite myself to hang out with them without my friend as the go-between.

,dating_advice,"Since I'm still in high school and in a relatively religious family, I am forced to go to Catholic mass every Sunday. Normally I zone out and pay zero attention to anyone else there, but occasionally I see this guy who I find very attractive, who is also there with his family. Because our families usually go to different masses, I almost never see him (only about once every 2 months or so). However, whenever we're both there we make a lot of awkward eye contact that at least feels like we're acknowledging each other's presence.

Last week at mass, he was wearing a sweatshirt from his high school, so I was able to figure out his name from the internet, as well as a few other basic details about him (yes I know it's creepy, it's a bad habit). However, I couldn't find any social media, so it seems like the only way to get his attention/ask him out is in person. If you know anything about (white) Roman Catholicism, you likely know that there are always people who sneak into mass a minute before it starts, and sculk out immediately after the closing song ends. My family is one of those. We don't stick around to socialize, it isn't something we do. This would make it very difficult to actually talk to the guy, which would already be weird because he's with his parents.

I wrote out a note with my number that I could pass him if I saw him in church today (I didn't) but it just feels weird and kind irreverent, even though I don't consider myself Catholic. I have never asked out anyone of the opposite sex before, and I feel like doing this could come across as needy/weird, especially because I have never talked to him. For all I know, he might not even be single. I'm not sure what the best thing to do here would be. The next time I see him, should I sneak him the note? Should I give up? I'm not sure.

He cheated on her at the end of the relationship and she broke up with him. He is still together with this girl he cheated with and last year he still tried to have contact with my date, sending sms when he drank too much, sent her money on her birthday. She has sent him something 3 months ago when she was at an old class room that remembered her of where they met, she sent him the photo with ""do you remember this room?"" She also has met him previous year (while he still was with his new girl) and they've had sex. According to her because he felt himself depressed and blablabla.
I'm dating this girl since 5 months ago and for 2 months ago she needed to contact him to transfer all his photo's onto a external hard disk and give it to him. She was done with him and had already blocked him on everything after i said it was not ok to still contact him with sending this photo of the classroom.

My date suddently starts feeling that this is not good, because she thinks he does not really like his fiancée and he's being pushed into it by her. She fears he might take his life (he tried it before and she stopped him) and now she wants to contact him.

I had a discussion with her where i said i feel this is not ok and the feeling she has is not even based on real danger. And if she contacts him she could make things worse because he can doubt things even more by thinking my date is still interested in him etc. She insists that she has a bad feeling that he will do something to himself and she cannot live with the thought of not having done something if that happens. I asked her if she plans to be his guardian for the rest of her life. She said this is the last time she will contact him. I replied: and next year you hear from a friend that he is very unhappy and depressed. What then, will you contact him again? She didn't answer properly to that anymore and just started crying.

I knew beforehand that he had a girlfriend (not sure how serious it is or how long they’ve been dating) but once I met him I started to have a little crush on him. The thing is, he’s been flirting with me lately. Finding excuses to sit next to me and touch me, other general flirting, etc. Enough where if he was single, I would for sure think he was into me.

If he had never acted like this toward me I’m sure I would have gotten over the crush pretty quickly. However, now I just feel in an uncomfortable position because I’ve been in a similar situation before and it did not end well. I know that to the single person, you build up all this hope, which is really for nothing, and for the person already in a relationship, they don’t give it a second thought about how they are playing with someone else’s emotions because to them, it’s all fun and games.

I’m just wondering if anyone has advice about how to handle this. There’s no way I’m not going to be seeing him because of our mutual friends and whenever I’ve seen him, he probably enjoys the attention/flirting from our interactions so I’m not sure what would make him stop.

,dating_advice,"There are two girls in my life that I can imagine spending the rest of my \[early-mid 20s male\] life with. Obviously I just want to start dating before it gets to that, but my intentions are for a serious relationship.

The first was my first high school crush that I got over, but years later we reconnected and feelings started to come up again (let's called her girl A). The second is someone I met at uni and only really got to know properly in the past couple of years (let's call her girl B).

They're both friends with each other (through netball), and I'm also friends with both of them.

So here's my dilemma: I'm not sure who to 'pick'. I know it's up to them to accept of course, but I'm close enough to both of them where I can imagine them both saying yes if I asked either girl A or girl B.

They're both very cautious and don't give anything away. When it comes to relationships, they don't say much about their own interests or who they like etc, so I guess in that respect I'm not close enough to them.

I don't spend a whole lot of 1 on 1 time with them, I want to do that when I'm ready to commit to one of them. But it feels so dirty thinking that I have to choose, or that I might regret my choice. Girl A knows more about me and vice versa and is a lot easier to talk to, but I'd really like to get to know girl B on a more personal level, there may be something there.

My parents are separated so me and my siblings suffered a lot during our childhood because of it. I just want to be sure I pick the right one, but I feel so unsure so any decision I make might not feel right...

I've known them both for years, and not sure if I'll get to know them any more than I know now unless I'm ready to commit to one of them.

I guess my options are

1: be patient, it'll be clear if I try to get to know them more (however long that may be).

2: these thoughts may mean I don't truly have feelings for them so i should forget the idea of dating either of them.

3: wing it, tell girl A, and potentially f\*\*k up

4: get to know girl B while having feelings (I think I have) for girl A

I'm not that open to the idea of dating one and then dating the other if it doesn't work out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, this has been doing my head in for months...

However I have this friend (24M) that I'm ridiculously close with. So close we lived together for a while. And spending that much time with another person you're that close with can stir up some feelings. We both liked each other in HS but never acted on it so I guess this was the time to do it right? Wrong. I still saw him as a friend after my breakup, he was very helpful with getting me through it (and other friends and family).  Yet he always hinted he was interested but I didn't want to stroke my ego about it and I could've been reading the signals wrong at the time. I had friends who told me wanted to date me and was in love with me. Again, never really believed his words because I think it just made sense with us seeing each other every day and he was confused; I don't have high self esteem so I couldn't understand why someone would. He and I drank one night, had some relations, talked it through, decided FWB for our next move since we both admitted yeah, no feelings (mind you he said it before I could). It was rare we ever had those relations again which was fine by me. Then again, I was always whenever he wanted it and somehow I'd get jipped every time which we talked about because I like to actually communicate any issues I have with people to find solutions.   
One day asked me out on a date and I had agreed to go to which he immediately said ""just need to work some more hours and we'll go."" I'm a pretty patient person but three months had gone by with hearing ""Need more money."" Finally I asked him about the date when month 4 was creeping up reminding him I wasn't rushing or pushing but, what's going on? Turns out he never wanted to ask in the first place and he had asked in the spur of the moment (he was high) but was too scared to hurt me so he let it drag on. The money went to a $1200 gaming desktop btw. I felt hurt but I let it go to save the friendship. I know it was my fault as well but we continued with the FWB for a while but then he started to, do BF stuff like grabbing my face and kissing it, cuddling, forehead and cheek kisses, hand on my thigh when we drive, holding me from behind when I'm at the stove, buying me gifts ""just because."" This has been going on for about 5 months (most recently last week). He constantly tells me  “You’re the only person who makes me better and feel comfortable with.”  Mind you three weeks ago he told me he's never actually liked or loved me in that way, despite my friends telling me the opposite before. I told him last night “hey maybe you do have feelings and just don’t wanna date anyone. That’s okay too."" Because ofc I had to question the touchy-feely stuff. He replied that if I date someone else he'd be happy for me and wouldn't do anything to stop it and that he's very sure he has no feelings for me. Plus it's heartbreaking when strangers and his own family hint I should date him or that he looks at me different than any other girl and I have to stand there and half smile.

,dating_advice,"Hi

Just as the title says. I can interact with people by imitating others, but I have no natural skills to engage in social interactions, conversations, dating. On the plus side, I know how to interact with others, because I have interacted with many people and I have seen how they behave, how they react and so on. As a consequence, I am good with normal interaction, I am able to hug a girl without being a creep, I am able to shake hands, I am able to some extent to keep eye contact by counting. That way I avoid having 0 eye contact, and staring at the other person and being a creep.

Nevertheless, I have never seen anybody dating, so I do not know how to do it. I can do some smalltalk of the type I do with friends, but nothing more, and that is a recipe for being friendzoned. I cannot tell the intentions of others, nor the reasons why they behave in one way or another. I have somehow convinced myself that if a person of the opposite sex is being nice, she is just being nice and is not flirting. This way of thinking is safer and saves me from scandals. But on the other hand, it keeps me from getting a girlfriend. Treating everything as ""just friendly"" is still better than the opposite, but it keeps me alone.

In other words, the lack of the natural ability to engage with others by trusting my instincts puts me in a very tough situation. I can only do things that I've learned with others, but I have never dated my friends, so there is no person I can imitate. And I do not have close enough friends to teach me. Does anyone know of any software or app that teaches dating? Or youtube channel? I need exposure, and I will never get it without at least the basics. At the end of the day, is it even worth it? I would just be a fake person. Actually, my entire social behavior is fake, but somehow it seems to do the job, so I am not sure if that is right or wrong. Anyway, before I write another essay, have you ever dated an autist, and would you? Do I have a chance to date? Should I go for other autists? Should I just quit?

As a consequence, I am good with normal interaction, I am able to hug a girl without being a creep, I am able to shake hands, I am able to some extent to keep eye contact by counting. That way I avoid having 0 eye contact, and staring at the other person and being a creep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I have never seen anybody dating, so I do not know how to do it. I can do some smalltalk of the type I do with friends, but nothing more, and that is a recipe for being friendzoned. I cannot tell the intentions of others, nor the reasons why they behave in one way or another. I have somehow convinced myself that if a person of the opposite sex is being nice, she is just being nice and is not flirting. This way of thinking is safer and saves me from scandals. But on the other hand, it keeps me from getting a girlfriend. Treating everything as &amp;quot;just friendly&amp;quot; is still better than the opposite, but it keeps me alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the lack of the natural ability to engage with others by trusting my instincts puts me in a very tough situation. I can only do things that I&amp;#39;ve learned with others, but I have never dated my friends, so there is no person I can imitate. And I do not have close enough friends to teach me. Does anyone know of any software or app that teaches dating? Or youtube channel? I need exposure, and I will never get it without at least the basics. At the end of the day, is it even worth it? I would just be a fake person. Actually, my entire social behavior is fake, but somehow it seems to do the job, so I am not sure if that is right or wrong. Anyway, before I write another essay, have you ever dated an autist, and would you? Do I have a chance to date? Should I go for other autists? Should I just quit? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a 20 year old male going to community college and working part time. I've had numerous chances to be with girls, but most of the time it just feels like we don't have enough in common.

Basically I just want a girl who wouldn't mind playing some casual couch coop video games with me, but also cares about getting out the house and doing things like working out together.

,dating_advice,"Backstory: I met this women I absolutely adore in one of my college classes. I’ve had a crush on her since day 1, and about 10 weeks into our class she approached me and we really hit it off. We’ve since gone on a couple dates since and everything seemed to be going extremely well. 

Fast forward to today. We have class together tomorrow (Monday) evening, so I messaged her and asked if she wanted to grab a cup of coffee together before class. She then responds by telling me I’m a great guy and that I’m very good to her, but she’s not very good to me. She then proceeds to tell me how she’s never been in a real relationship before and all she knows is being alone. This caught me off guard, since I thought everything was going extremely well and she hadn’t really shown any signs of wanting to break things off whenever we were together (which wasn’t very long to be fair). I do genuinely enjoy her company, and I don’t want to lose her as a friend. So I sent her back a message detailing how I care about her, and that she doesn’t have to deal with these feelings alone.

&lt;p&gt;The whole online dating experience for me has been a slow decline downhill for my mental state and personal life. I kinda wish I never seriously got into tinder because I find myself caring and overthinking about stuff that didn’t use to matter to me. Like how many Snapchat friends I have or who can I snap with next so my score can go up. Before I was just content with binge watching shows and getting good grades. At this point I can barely focus on watching anything or studying because I’m thinking about Snapchat scores and matches on tinder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame these apps directly because i know I’m responsible for my own shit and I just need to delete tinder and come back when my life is more stable but then I think about what I might miss out on or who’ll see that my profile has been locked. Those are the main things preventing me from deleting the app despite desperately needing to.&lt;/p&gt;

Preface: I'm a ""man seeking woman"".

I have this theory that online dating has removed (or lessened the need for) the element of flirtation. I think this is because both sides know there is interest, otherwise they wouldn't be chatting or agree to meet up in person. In more traditional dating, flirtation helps the other person know there is attraction, and it can have the positive side-effect of creating some element of sexual tension, which I think there needs to be at least a little of when you start dating someone.

So there's this problem I keep seeing, where I chat with someone and it's all really formal, and I can't seem to find a way to make it more playful. And she seems nice, so we meet up in person, and it's still really formal. I try to find some way to make it more flirtatious and playful, but I'm not very good at that and she doesn't bite. And I don't want to go too far, because I want to respect any boundaries she has.

I end up feeling like we have stuff in common and she is a really nice person, but there's no spark. And then we talk about seeing each other again, and I don't know how to say, yeah, I had fun talking with you, we have a lot in common, but it doesn't feel like there's any romantic attraction here. So maybe we meet up again, same thing, and I then just let it fade, or I awkwardly try to explain the above.

This feels common enough to me that it seems I should ask the question here, see if anyone has answers. Because hey, if something, keeps happening to you, you're the constant. So maybe there's specific things I can do differently.

So, how do you keep flirtation alive in online dating? And how do you tell someone early on that you don't think there's a spark, when they want to see you again?",t2_612x9,False,,0,False,How do you flirt with someone in online dating?,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e834pl,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575885178.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, how do you tell them when it won&amp;#39;t work?&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Title says it all.

I [M 23] have been going on a few dates now with this girl [F 22]. Every date has been fun and we've been progressing in a healthy way (e.g., setting up expectations and boundaries early on). Well at the end of our date last night when I was dropping her off at her apartment, she asked me if I wanted to come up to her room. I basically got cold feet and said I couldn't because I had work at 9am (which was true). She understood and we just ended the night with some good bye kissing before her leaving my car. 

But the bigger reason as to why I said no is that I have extreme performance anxiety in bed. I am always anxious on whether or not I'm pleasuring who ever I'm with and that stems off the fact that I'm not the biggest down there. And when I'm anxious, I usually don't last long. With those two together, I feel like it isn't a very satisfying ending on either side. Even worst is that I get a lot more pleasure from giving rather than receiving so when this all happens I just get frustrated and very discouraged in having sex (it's been a good year or so since I've had it just because of this anxiety). 

But I know that once I'm comfortable with a person (e.g., someone I was in a relationship with for a while and know what pleasures them) I don't get anxious, lasted much longer, and it was a better experience for everyone. But that was after being in a relationship for 2-3 months. I obviously won't hit that same level of comfort with someone I just started going on dates with. 

I know there's other ways to pleasure someone such as oral and foreplay, and believe me I will always start off with that because 1. I really like giving oral and foreplay 2. Usually means the session last longer than if we jumped straight to fucking, but eventually it will come to fucking and my anxiety flares up and then I lose all stamina. 

Any tips for getting over this anxiety? Im aware it's very much a mental block that I'm putting up against myself, but it's hard to ignore when media and porn all equate larger size with more pleasure

&lt;p&gt;But I know that once I&amp;#39;m comfortable with a person (e.g., someone I was in a relationship with for a while and know what pleasures them) I don&amp;#39;t get anxious, lasted much longer, and it was a better experience for everyone. But that was after being in a relationship for 2-3 months. I obviously won&amp;#39;t hit that same level of comfort with someone I just started going on dates with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there&amp;#39;s other ways to pleasure someone such as oral and foreplay, and believe me I will always start off with that because 1. I really like giving oral and foreplay 2. Usually means the session last longer than if we jumped straight to fucking, but eventually it will come to fucking and my anxiety flares up and then I lose all stamina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips for getting over this anxiety? Im aware it&amp;#39;s very much a mental block that I&amp;#39;m putting up against myself, but it&amp;#39;s hard to ignore when media and porn all equate larger size with more pleasure &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr: at the end the night, my date asked me to come up to her room but I got cold feet from performance anxiety in bed because lack of size and the thought that they&amp;#39;re not enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"A little background, a few weeks ago I went to my friends senior recital. Afterwards I stayed to congratulate her and there was food and punch. This brunette girl was staring at me hard, and I’ll admit I’m not social at all, and I have BPD and really struggle with signs. She was staring at me so hard I felt like I had to say something? So I said hi and she stood up and walked up very close to me facing me and started asking me about my personal life, where do I work, how do I know the girl that was doing her senior recital (our mutual friend) and telling me all about herself. I didn’t really get much out because she was so talkative but I think she liked me? I can’t tell though because I really don’t understand flirting.

I’ve thought about it for a while and I did enjoy my time with her, and she was pretty cute! Not my normal type but I still think she’s attractive.

Unfortunately I couldn’t remember her name, I get nervous talking to people I don’t know and tend to forget most of everything. But I would like to talk to her again and get to know her better. We’re both 22-24 ish.

Would it be weird to ask our mutual friend for her contact information? I don’t know her mutual friend super well either, just well enough to support her for her senior recital. The girl I was talking to said she hangs out with our mutual friend at least twice a week, so they’re probably fairly close? 

Any advice would be appreciated, I know there’s other fish in the sea I guess, so if it would come off really bad, then I just won’t pursue her. I don’t get hints or sarcasm so be straight please and thank you.

,dating_advice,"So I met a chick at a party. She seemed popular. She was cute and we ended up hanging out alone together and drinking heaps. She showed me crafts she was making. We were both having fun and got close and cuddling. She had way too much to drink and was falling asleep so I put her to bed and went home.

I sent her a message the next day, but she seemed a little uninterested, so I stopped there and haven't had any interest from her since.

I guess she thinks I'm too young or maybe she was just too drunk.

Is it worth messaging this chick again in a few days to see if she wants to get a drink on the weekend, or should I forget it? If she was into me, wouldn't she have wanted to chat? If it was just a drunk thing I'd rather leave it where it is.

She had way too much to drink and was falling asleep so I put her to bed and went home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent her a message the next day, but she seemed a little uninterested, so I stopped there and haven&amp;#39;t had any interest from her since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess she thinks I&amp;#39;m too young or maybe she was just too drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"So I (22F) got out of a 4 year relationship back during the summer. I have been just doing my own thing for the past while, kind of refinding myself. 

I went back to university again and started participating in my program events (which I had not for the past year). Within this I reconnected with an old friend (22M) that I went to elementary school and highschool with. I stopped talking to him once we graduated highschool bc we went off to separate schools for a while. But he took me off of all social media except Facebook after that. 

Now we are in the same program and I see him all the time now. We barely talked bc I didn’t want to follow him around when I transferred. I kept my distance and he’s only approached me and actually said hi when he was drunk. But most occasions he just kept physically bumping into me but since we were in a bar and such I just thought of it being that he was drunk and didn’t notice he was doing it... Until it became persistent. But sober he would only make eye contact with me whenever we saw each other but would never actually say anything. After our short hello, hello interaction neither of us said much...until this week.

The semester is done and I decided to go out one night to a bar and this is also somewhere I usually see him. But I went about my business as usual so he could do the same. At the very end of the night his friends went to the washroom as they were preparing to leave and he saw me standing on my own so he called out to me and came to say hi. He said he’s been meaning to come talk to me and I apologized for not approaching him also. He started to ask how I’ve been and such and then his friends came back from the washroom and said hurry up bc they had to catch the bus outside. So he said he needed to go but he said it’s ok we see each other all the time so next time DON’T BE SHY, doesn’t matter if I’m with a bunch of people pls come say hi. He gave me a big hug which I don’t think we’ve done since grade 8 grad. And then he told his friends who I was before they started heading out. (His one friend weirdly hung back and asked if I wanted to go home with my friend like he was trying to set us up) I just said me and him are childhood friends and politely declined. 

But this whole thing got me thinking. Back in highschool we got to a point where we were decent friends but I was painfully shy and I think I made it hard to get close to me. So even though I got the feeling he might be harbouring some feelings, I think both of us shoved them aside to keep it more like a bro/sis relationship. We then went on to date other people, him for a short time and he’s been single since but I dated my bf for 4 years. This is the first time in a while we have both been single at the same time. 

I genuinely enjoyed his company back then and there’s something very familiar and comfortable about having him here at school with me now. I don’t know if there’s relationship potential with him or if we should just stay friends but all I know is I feel this insane urge to catch up and get to know him better. I don’t know why but it’s almost like I missed him. Some people have said maybe he had feelings and never told me and maybe now he’s curious. But I don’t want to read too far into stuff that may just be him being friendly. But nonetheless I used to really value our friendship in the past and I kind of want to rekindle that but also let him actually get to know me better this time. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about this? Or how I can figure out what he thinks of me? How can I reconnect with him and maybe try to initiate actually hanging out? He also loves dancing but I suck at two stepping so I almost want him to teach me. I feel like if never try to see what potential there is here, I’ll always be wondering “what if?” in the future. 

Because he’s so awkward when he’s sober (ONLY with me might I add) I’m afraid of scaring him off. I wanted to suggest catching up with him sometime but idk if that’s too forward to start and I forgot to say it the other night during that interaction. He seems fairly ok with being touchy and he didn’t shy away from a hug and that’s not something we’ve ever really done in the past. I think him finally talking to me one on one was his way of saying it’s my turn to initiate. I’m so nervous to overdue it by accident bc he was drunk when we had that brief conversation but I am super drawn to him and can’t seem to ignore his presence either. We have a lot in common but there’s still a lot to discover since we’ve been apart for 4 years. 

Help a girl out?? 

TL;DR 

How can I (22F) reconnect with an old childhood friend (22M) to see what potential there is for us (good friends or lovers) ? And how can I try to figure out what he thinks of me? Since I don’t know if he ever liked me but was too scared to complicate our friendship. (Apparently a lot of people liked me before but I was oblivious to it).

I just got out of a 5 year open relationship with someone who I'm no contact with. What happened with side chick is that she broke up with me like the same day that my primary partner did. It wasn't really related, but because of that I stopped talking to side chick too. It was just too much for me to handle all at once.

,dating_advice,"This sounds like it doesn't make sense, but I want you to try something the first chance you get after reading this post.

Turn on the cold water all the way up in your shower and don't even touch the hot water.  Let the water run for a while so it can be at it's coldest.  Take off all of your clothes and jump into the shower.  The quicker you jump in without thinking about it, the easier it becomes to take a cold shower.

So how is this gonna help you with  approach anxiety?

When you  know you have to take a cold shower, you'll notice your heart rate increase and you'll become very hesitant.  You'll get very worked up and even consider turning on the hot water.  The moment before you jump in is the most uncomfortable part about taking the cold shower.

Let's say you want to ask a girl you like out on a date, you'll have the same feelings as you would the moment before taking a cold shower.

By taking daily, cold showers, you're conditioning your mind and body to jump into situations that feel uncomfortable.  One of the many good benefits of taking cold showers is a boost in testosterone and a boost in a good mood.  After you take a cold shower, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment.

You don't even have to stay in for a really long time.  You can start off with 1-2 minutes and work your way up to 5 minutes.  Make sure you get every part of your body in that cold water (even your genitals).

Cold showers also keep you living in the present moment.  Being uncomfortable for one minute will feel like 5 minutes.  You're aware and in your body because the cold water will not allow you to get stuck in your head.  Men who are in their body and not stuck in their heads become very attractive to women.

After a few weeks of taking cold showers, you may notice that you're more alert and aware.  You're willing to take on more challenges.  If there's a woman you would like to date, you're willing to talk to her as soon as possible, despite how attractive she is.  It's not about getting the girl at this point, it's about taking on uncomfortable challenges and feeling the accomplishment of taking action.",t2_de835m0,False,,0,False,Eliminating Approach Anxiety With Cold Showers?,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e7sizo,False,dark,,public,15,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,15,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575831819.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds like it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, but I want you to try something the first chance you get after reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Okay, some backstory:
The guy in question got my attention by constantly throwing obvious compliments my way during our shared university classes. 
We got talking at a party, he wanted to exchange numbers and soon after, we started texting frequently. 
To me it felt like we really ""clicked"" on all levels - from humour, to interests, to personal morals etc. 

We set up a date andn as it turns out, we get along just as well in real life as we do in text!
After spending four hours together, he kissed me and honestly, for the first time in my life I felt like I'd found someone I could see myself being in a long-term relationship with. 

Afterwards, we kept in contact, I told him how much I enjoyed our time together and that I really wanted to see him again.
Without going into too much detail, from the way he interacted with me (both in person and in text), I felt like he, too, was really into me and we set up a second date a week later.

At the beginning of the date, he immediately told me (apologetically) that he had to leave early. 
No problem; we spent an hour just talking and having fun and he opened up and told me some pretty personal things about his past experiences with depression.

As he had to leave, he said that he had to be honest with me and tell me something he'd spent the past week thinking about.
Basically, he thinks I'm a really cool, fun, intelligent person whom he genuinely likes but due to personal issues he did not want to go into (and neither did I in that moment), he cannot give me a serious relationship at this point in time (if that is what I expect of him).

Taken aback, I simply told him I'm grateful for his honesty. He seemed seriously relieved I reacted so well, insisting we keep in contact and asking me to accompany him to the train station. He even gave me a hug, lol.
(Little did he know I cried my eyes out for two days straight afterwards, haHA... ha.)

Because I'd been kinda short on words after his ""confession"", I sent him a voice message two days later, stating that although I'd had different hopes for us, I very much respected his decision and that I, too, wanted to keep contact.

Well, it's been a week now. 
Needless to say, I'm very much still in love with this guy, haha. 
We say hi to each other in university but mostly, we've gone back to communicating via text. 
Again, I just feel like he really enjoys talking to me, we joke around, it's great fun and god damnit, I just don't know what to do.

**I'm selfish - I really don't want to move on. I feel like it'd be stupid to do so, even, because I'm like 90% sure he, too, has feelings for me.

Honestly, I'd like to figure out what's troubling him and maybe try to help him cope because I really, honestly care about him as a person.
At the same time, I don't want to intrude and I've promised him to respect his choice. 
I've been thinking about inviting him out for drinks just to chat - but I can't deny that deep down, I still desperately want him to change his mind.

&lt;p&gt;**I&amp;#39;m selfish - I really don&amp;#39;t want to move on. I feel like it&amp;#39;d be stupid to do so, even, because I&amp;#39;m like 90% sure he, too, has feelings for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#39;d like to figure out what&amp;#39;s troubling him and maybe try to help him cope because I really, honestly care about him as a person.
At the same time, I don&amp;#39;t want to intrude and I&amp;#39;ve promised him to respect his choice. 
I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about inviting him out for drinks just to chat - but I can&amp;#39;t deny that deep down, I still desperately want him to change his mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I continue? And if any of you have ever been in a similar position to his, could you maybe give me some insight into what might be going on inside him?**&lt;/p&gt;

We both live in the same town, and we see each other a lot because we both work in the same building, but in different stores, so I would see her a lot on breaks and stuff.

We dont really Snap / text outside of just streaks and general stuff. She always just gives off a flirty vibe around me and shes always laughing and joking around. She also always stands just a little too close or lightly brushes against me holds eye contact when one of us is talking.

She also asked me if I had a girlfriend back at school (i thought that was a big sign but idk for sure) and she was telling me about how some other guy asked her out but she said no and we joked about it.

She told me shes single but shes looking to date someone right now

I was talking to her and another friend and she said something like “you should take us on dates” 

She will do stuff like ask if I missed her and if she is my favorite customer, she also blew me a kiss as she walked out of my store one day.

My study program was starting in October so before that began I figured I should ask her out. I texted her one day to see if she wanted to hang out and get dinner that night, but she said she was already going out with friends.

So I still dont know what that meant. I think I wasnt clear enough that im interested and I should have asked her in person.

Anyway, I saw her once again before I left.
I expected it to be a little awkward so i just pretended like it didnt happen and she was still very flirty. She talked a lot, always looked in my eyes, played dumb games with me, she even said we vibe really well together.

She also kept mentioning that someone had complimented her nice eyes.

So i didnt ask her out again there because I thought that may be too soon and I didnt want to come off as needy or pushy. And also I would he gone for a while. She gave me a hug goodbye before I left.

So anyway, this trip was from like the second week of October to December (idk why the scheduling is so odd my school is just weird like that)

She would sometimes respond to my Snaps more for like a week or two and then go quiet again. We didn’t really talk over text or anything bc I was busy doing stuff and she didnt initiate.

Now we just send streaks most of the time but she is consistently one of the first people to view all my stories and stuff (not sure how much of a sign that is but ive heard people mention it)

So this trip is over (great experience) and now that Im back im thinking about her again. I go back to work week so Im probably going to see her.

So how can I bring that spark back and get a for-sure date with her this time. And does it sound like she was / still might be interested?

,dating_advice,"Hey guys. So for this year I (26M) decided to quit drinking, which is pretty unusual in the UK for my age. I also dont use dating apps cos I like talking to people and dont want to hide behind a screen. 

So when I'm out and about or travelling, I try to talk to lots of people, and of course girls. I can't tell you how much I've improved over the course of the year when it comes to approaching/asking out girls. Before I was just hiding behind the veil of alcohol, needing to be drunk for confidence. Now I dont need anything. Honestly it's pretty liberating, I recommend others to try it too :) 

Anyways, sometimes I struggle with gauging a girls interest, and whether or not they want me to ask her out. I read on Reddit about how girls like to be given a guys number instead of asking for it (when they are working, for example) so I heeded this advice and gave a girl I was chatting to in a shop my number. Shes really nice and we texted for a few weeks but it didn't go anywhere. 

Today I was at a jewellery shop with my parents and the girl working there gave me a big smile when I entered. We chatted for a bit about organic fruit lol (she asked me where I worked when I referenced working in a shop, but I meant volunteer) and we were talking about about pesticides on apples. I'd kinda feel awkward asking her out with my parents there, but thought she was pretty cute and was kinda interested in me. 

I was thinking of going in tomorrow (not sure if she is working or not) and leaving my number there as well as an organic apple haha. Kinda cheesy but I thought it would be funny even if she wasn't interested/has a bf. 

Anyways, what are some signs you give that you are interested in a guy you have just met? .

From my experience, I think the main one would be asking you lots of questions/interested in you. Hair flicks/smiling and enthusiasm when interacting with you. I could be off though and I'm sure there are more so please enlighten me.

Shes really nice and we texted for a few weeks but it didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was at a jewellery shop with my parents and the girl working there gave me a big smile when I entered. We chatted for a bit about organic fruit lol (she asked me where I worked when I referenced working in a shop, but I meant volunteer) and we were talking about about pesticides on apples. I&amp;#39;d kinda feel awkward asking her out with my parents there, but thought she was pretty cute and was kinda interested in me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of going in tomorrow (not sure if she is working or not) and leaving my number there as well as an organic apple haha. Kinda cheesy but I thought it would be funny even if she wasn&amp;#39;t interested/has a bf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, what are some signs you give that you are interested in a guy you have just met? .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience, I think the main one would be asking you lots of questions/interested in you. Hair flicks/smiling and enthusiasm when interacting with you. I could be off though and I&amp;#39;m sure there are more so please enlighten me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;

As for me browsing others' profiles, most of them seem very similar but on occasion one stands out a bit and I take the time to write a personalized message (never copy/pasted). The number of replies I've gotten I can count on one hand (and you can't even see what you had sent or whether it was read unless the other person likes you back, even for subscribers).

I've been under the impression that this is partly due to women getting barraged with messages that they don't even look at most. I have to wonder how many messages I've sent that drowned in someone's inbox...

Anyways, I got used to most of this and accepted that for the most part OKC is a longshot, whether due to finding the right crowd of people or getting heard in the crowd. However, a couple of days ago I read a profile that sounded so much like the kind of person I was interested in that I took a couple of days to get a really good intro message to send, but I have no idea if it will get seen or I might get a reply. And me being the curious person (but not expecting much after a friend telling me how many people use a nickname/fake name), I googled the name and the city and found them through the performing arts organization they worked in.

So a girl I really like decided it was best for us to part ways last week.

We knew each other for about a month and a half, met through a dating app, and had only gone on 2 dates because we lived kind of far (2 hrs) from each other, and I didn't have a car at the time to make the trip. But she did something amazing. She decided to make the trip to see me, twice.

The story of how we met was quite special to me. From the start, we both were really attracted to each other, and we ended up thinking the other person was a catfish until I sent her a selfie with a hand-written apology on a napkin. We had our first date at IHOP, and spent over 9 hours together that day. We both agreed our first date was amazing. But things started falling apart after our second date.

In the last conversation we had (which was 3 days before we would meet again, and almost 3 wks after our second date), she told me she felt ""bad vibes"" and was ""uncomfortable"" when she was around me, and that we should stop seeing each other. At first I was surprised and confused, and I tried to reason with her, but ultimately that was how the conversation ended, with the notion that I gave off bad vibes and discomfort when she was around me.

After having heart-to-hearts with my family and friends, I think I know exactly why she felt that way. I realized the mistake I most likely made during our second date, and I want to try and make things right with her. I felt so terrible and apologetic about it, that it was what inspired me to make the video.

So I came up with an idea to make a selfie video to share with her what came out of the conversations I had with my family and friends. She is the centerpiece of all this, and I think she deserves to know. It's my attempt at regaining her trust, friendship, and for me to own up to my mistake and move on. The video contains me admitting that my action was wrong, it contains selfie videos from 3 of my friends who shared their input about me as a person. Towards the end, I play a song i wrote for her on the guitar reminding her about how we met.

I want her to know that I have a good heart, that I'm genuinely not that kind of person to make people feel uncomfortable, and it hurts me that she felt THAT uncomfortable around me. I never want anyone to feel that way when they're around me.

9 days after we last spoke, I messaged her a link to the video. It's been 48 hours since I messaged her about the videos. She hasn't responded. Idk if she watched it or not. 

After having watched the 3 parts, do you think I did too much? Thoughts about my actions, the videos, etc?

Title says it all. My company had its annual holiday party and a third-party consultant who just started at our office approached me.

I've seen him around once or twice, but this is the first time we really got to know each other. Despite some political differences, we got along well and before we knew it, the party was over. We went to a bar nearby, had another drink and I agreed to go back to his place. 

I'll spare you the details, but long story short, the sex wasn't satisfying for either party. Blame it on the alcohol or being in completely new surrounds and not feeling comfortable. The guy was nice about it though, and I stayed the night. 

To be honest, I've never had a one night stand—let alone one with a (kinda) coworker. I feel like I disappointed the poor guy, and that I'm a bad person. 

Would I want to see him again? I'm conflicted about that too. I like to keep my work life and personal life separate, plus our political differences might seem small now, but they could end up being hard to look past in the long run.

I'm not out to bother him. We actually shared an elevator ride out the way out two nights later and had friendly small talk.

I (21M) matched with this girl on tinder(19). Last week we had our first date and it went really well. I felt comfortable around her and there were no awkward moments. When she left she told me that she hopes i want to see her again and that she had a great time, and i told her i felt the same way and i want to see her again too. So i think it's going well, but there is this one thing that has been on my mind.

When we started talking on tinder she responded within every 20-30 minutes, but when we started texting she started responding slower and slower. Sometimes she takes up to 5 hours to respond, but when she does she seems interested. Before you say that maybe she is just not a person who is on her phone much, she sends me snapchats and posts on instagram and sometimes texts me on snapchat but ignores me through text.

,dating_advice,"26M I go out sometimes with friends and it's usually a small group of all men. However, sometimes a girl or 2 will join our group and the girls we approach will be noticeably warmer than when it's just us guys. They'll be more likely to continue the conversation or even come up and initiate with us.

For example, on my 26th birthday I was at a bar/club and went up to talk to a girl and she was giving me short responses and eventually said she had a boyfriend as a way to end the conversation. Later that night I was talking to a female friend when the same girl from earlier walked by and ended up joining the conversation and stayed for a few minutes. It was like night and day in terms of her interest level. This isn't the only time this has happened and it wasn't hard for me to see a trend.

I'm thinking that being a single man or in a group of all men might give off predatory vibes because women generally seem more relaxed when you already have a woman with you. It feels counter-intuitive because when I see a girl out with a guy a don't even bother because I assume that's her man. It could be her brother, coworker, or gay friend but I generally assume it's a date or one of the guys in the group is her partner and I don't approach.

Things seemed to be going well, and there seemed to be mutual interest. Things had developed into texting everyday, and when we met we always held hands and all that. I was starting to think it could develop into something serious. However, she then suddenly seemed to lose interest somewhat, and i started to feel like i was losing her. One night when i was out with friends, she texted me her wherabouts, and i just found her at the bar kissing some guy. She saw me and just continued with her thing. I was disgusted and really hurt, but i didn't go over to confront her. She still texted me days after this, and then she suddenly deleted me from snapchat out of nowhere. No explanation or anything. I didn't understand why she did this. This weekend i randomly met her at the bar. I had no idea she was out, but we ended up talking. During this conversation she said ""no"", when i asked if she had ever really liked me, admitted to having had sex with the guy she kissed last weekend, and said she lost interest after our ""last date"". She also gave an impression of being condescending, at least from my point of view. I was really fucking hurt, and i was shocked at how she could just change her feelings towards me so abrubtly and seemingly without feeling bad.

Next day, she messages me (on text message since she deleted me from snapchat) and says ""Hey i'm really sorry about last night. I wasn't nice to you at all. I'm ashamed actually. Sorry"". I replied ""what do you mean specifically?"". She didn't reply yesterday, and nothing today either, even though she's seen the message. I get easily attached to something like this, and i can't stop thinking about it, and i deal with it a lot easier when i have some closure. So, her not replying at all isn't really helping me. Since she actually showed remorse, i was hoping she would at least talk to me a bit to just clear up some things. She seems to be the type to run away from problems (deleting me from snapchat without saying anything, and me not doing anything wrong, for example). I also don't remember everything from our convo that night, so i would like to hear her reasonings. My reply was also not really good i realise. Do i look like a clown if i double text her?

She also gave an impression of being condescending, at least from my point of view. I was really fucking hurt, and i was shocked at how she could just change her feelings towards me so abrubtly and seemingly without feeling bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day, she messages me (on text message since she deleted me from snapchat) and says &amp;quot;Hey i&amp;#39;m really sorry about last night. I wasn&amp;#39;t nice to you at all. I&amp;#39;m ashamed actually. Sorry&amp;quot;. I replied &amp;quot;what do you mean specifically?&amp;quot;. She didn&amp;#39;t reply yesterday, and nothing today either, even though she&amp;#39;s seen the message. I get easily attached to something like this, and i can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about it, and i deal with it a lot easier when i have some closure. So, her not replying at all isn&amp;#39;t really helping me. Since she actually showed remorse, i was hoping she would at least talk to me a bit to just clear up some things. She seems to be the type to run away from problems (deleting me from snapchat without saying anything, and me not doing anything wrong, for example). I also don&amp;#39;t remember everything from our convo that night, so i would like to hear her reasonings. My reply was also not really good i realise. Do i look like a clown if i double text her? Yes, i know it&amp;#39;s over either way, but i hate leaving it as it is now. Do you advise me to not text her at all? If i should text something, what would that be?&lt;/p&gt;

2. She does not really react when I put my arm around her shoulder, I am not sure if she's just comfortable with this or she does not know how to push them off, or she really likes it.. I really do not know

3. She told he how this other coworker was negative towards her, and that she ""likes"" him, but when I asked her if she had a crush on her she said ""oh no"" she definitely does not and when I pressed her on it she says ""Like"" and ""Crush"" are two different things and got a little upset. This one has really messed with me, because she talking about another guy, but at the same time she could be doing that just make me jealous and telling me to ""make my move soon"" or it could be ""eff off I am not into you"" 

4. She wanted to give me a hug when I wasn't at work for a few days because of a cold, but I turned it down because I did not know want to give her my cold.. (Doh! now that I think of it I should not of just let her give me the hug)

5. When we were sitting next to each other in team meetings, I always noticed her foot seems to touch my leg, and when I turned over she says ""Sorry about that""

6. On whatsapp sometimes she appears cold, I texted a blushing smiley emoji and a sleeping emoji after she send me a text wishing I had a good nights rest, because she knew I did not have a good sleep earlier, she did not reply to that. I know I may be overthinking this, but then again I am not sure again.

7. When she was struggling with a task at work and it was past the end of our shift., I offered to stay to help, she said I did not have to, but I stayed anyways until I felt she was comfortable enough to finish the task, I ended up leaving anyways as I had other commitments I had to do after work,




Those are the things I have noticed, and honestly I am not sure if she likes me or not. I know I have given her a few signs that I want her attention, but I am not sure if she feels it or not. 

I plan on manning up and asking her out on a date and see how it goes, but I want to prepare for the worst case scenario where I get rejected and that I misinterpreted those signs, so if I get rejected (which is a possibility) how should I approach this while maintaining a professional friendship?

,dating_advice,"Alright, so this girl and I shared a class this past semester at college. We saw each other 3 days a week and sat next to each other for every lecture. As the semester went on we talked more and more and we both even started showing up early to class so we could talk more with each other. We got together a couple of times to work on homework and study and I asked her out to lunch twice to places around campus. 

Everything came together last night when I asked if she wanted to come over and watch a movie she had mentioned that she liked. She said yes, I went and picked her up and we watched the movie at my apartment. Nothing really happened during it more than me just putting my arm around her. After the movie we decided to watch an episode of one of her favorite shows. Things got more touchy and at the end of it she turned to look at me, I looked at her, she looked at my lips and then I went for it. It was like the entire semester of tension between us came out right then and there. It was really intense and clearly she was into it. It progressed and I took her into my room and we did everything accept actual sex to this point. 

So when I asked she kinda freaked out and said no, and had a sort of mini panic attack. I asked if everything was okay, and that we didn't have to. I got dressed and asked again if she was okay and she told me that she had actually been raped a couple weeks ago. Earlier in the semester she told me before class that she was going home for the weekend because she was going through some stuff, and last night she told me that was because she was raped the weekend prior.

I ended up driving her home at 3 in the morning in mostly total silence and when she got out she thanked me for the night and that was that. I texted her this afternoon checking to make sure she was okay and apologized if I made her feel uncomfortable in any way, I also let her know that I enjoyed hanging out with her and would want to again in the future if she was okay with that. She replied saying that she was okay, and that I didn't make her feel uncomfortable in any way, she just wasn't ready for anything sexual at this point.  She also said she had fun and would want to hang out again, but just as friends.

So my issue is that I really, really like this girl. I have been in two very bad relationships before this, but this girl seems different and I actually took my time getting to know her before anything progressed. What should I do in this situation? Do I just forget about her because she isn't looking for a relationship, or do I be friends with her instead even though that is going to hurt a lot knowing my feelings for her.

We saw each other 3 days a week and sat next to each other for every lecture. As the semester went on we talked more and more and we both even started showing up early to class so we could talk more with each other. We got together a couple of times to work on homework and study and I asked her out to lunch twice to places around campus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything came together last night when I asked if she wanted to come over and watch a movie she had mentioned that she liked. She said yes, I went and picked her up and we watched the movie at my apartment. Nothing really happened during it more than me just putting my arm around her. After the movie we decided to watch an episode of one of her favorite shows. Things got more touchy and at the end of it she turned to look at me, I looked at her, she looked at my lips and then I went for it.

I have never been one to fancy people to the point where I don't remember ever liking somebody in that regard. Because of this, I have never been in a relationship with anybody - I have never been asked out and have never wanted to be.

That was until I met this guy at my University. We'll call him 'Jack'.

'Met' feels like too strong of a word. I see Jack around campus and I know that he went to the same high school as me even though I didn't notice him back then. I haven't really interacted with him in person other than an excessive amount of eye-contact and the one time I walked into him, muttered a quick 'sorry' before running away out of pure mortification.

Over the past few months it has felt like everyone around me has found love. My sister has recently gotten engaged, my little brother has his first girlfriend and my best friend (who had the same experience in relationships as i do) has become serious with this guy. Also, I have recently discovered that my friend from class has a big crush on me and is planning on asking me out during our New Year's party, despite making it very clear that I don't like him in that way.

Because of all this, I have taken the initiative to message Jack. I would have prefered talking to him but he is always with his friends and I don't really have a subject I can casually start with him. My best friend told me he was the vice-president the council for the Uni so I spontaneously messaged him asking how to go about joining as it was the only thing I could think to say without making it obvious why I was really messaging him.

I have spent most of my life being reasonably shy and reserved, however, in the last year or so I've made some big changes to become more social (became head of the biggest club on my campus, go to bars more often). I have also tried dating more, and have been on a dozen or so dates this past year.

Normally, going on this many dates would be good, however, the problem is that I can only ever get 1 date. Out of these dozen dates I have not been able to get a 2nd date, resulting in a great deal of frustration. I honestly don't know what I'm doing that has led to such bad luck. I'm fairly awkward but all my female friends describe me as someone who is pretty good looking (I hit the gym 6 times a week) and would be ""a good boyfriend"". I think that I might have alexithymia, so I can't identify my own feelings or others feelings very well.

Heres an example:

Month or so I meet a really cute and charming girl at a bar, she recognized me as the leader of the aforementioned club on campus. We talked for a while then kissed, then she left with her friends. I few weeks later I see her at one of my clubs events, I chat with her for a bit. Then a week later she texts me and asks if I want to watch a movie with her. I go over, we watch the movie, cuddle for a bit, then kiss for a few seconds. She then tells me ""this is going a bit fast for me"". We went to a sporting event and it was super awkward the entire time. She told me she wanted to do dinner a few days later. I text her the day of in the morning and she leaves me on read.

,dating_advice,"Hello All!

Question here- I have been on dating apps and make it gently clear that I am not looking for something casual or a hook up.  I was recently matched with a man (37m) last week, and right away he came off with wanting more photos of me to prove who I am, and that ""clearly I can see"" how worth it he is"" from his profile.  He explained he had been catfished before, and that he was looking for his life partner, and that person needed to have a good body.  I did send a better photo of my whole body (clothed) which he seemed very attracted by.  After that, it was clear he wanted to have sex right away as he needed the ""physical connection before he can make an emotional connection"", and I was feeling that if I did not oblige, I would not have an opportunity with him.

Through the course of the conversation, it was evident sex right away was important as he needed ""a test drive"" to ensure I could turn him on, as I have only had one sexual partner before, and expressed that sex had been painful due to a few reasons.  Long story short, we never actually met in person and gone our separate ways.

After all this, I have deleted dating apps for some downtime as I am frustrated and don't feel that is a good headspace to be in for dating.  What behavior is this?  Are those essentially pick up lines to get someone into bed, that they are looking for their life partner, etc?  I am 33f divorced, and was with the same partner (first and only) for 12 years, then took about a year and half to make sure I was stable and healed, in order to meet someone else halfway.

,dating_advice,"So I [22M] work in retail while I’m in college. We have this seasonal worker who started working here a couple of months ago. She[18-19] is super nice and we have some alright conversation. She is also in college. Well when I first met her I thought she was very cute. She is artistic, and funny, and just a sweet girl. When we first talked I assumed it was just to be nice, but lately she actually comes up to tell me things happening in her life.

On thanksgiving(we worked together for the entire night) she told me her boyfriend broke up with her. I also found out the company I work for is going out of business. We have already started liquidation and I’ll have to find a new job here shortly. Lately I’ve been debating if I should just say fuck it and ask her out. Which brings me to where I would like others opinions. First being age gap. It isn’t that big it’s max 4 years. Could be 3 if she’s turning 19 soon I don’t know I just know she graduated high school this year. The next is somewhat embarrassing but I’m def overweight. I do hit the gym fairly often and I’ve dropped some lbs over time, I don’t look awfully fat, most people are surprised when I tell them my weight. My height also really helps with that given I’m 6’2(I weight around 250 but sometimes I get as low as 230, if y’all need I’ll post a picture of myself).

 I feel like I lost it or something.
I feel like girls aren’t the same with me anymore ?

,dating_advice,"33F, Dating guy, 30M, for almost 2 months now. Have been friends w him on/off for 2 years now. He's stated he's always wanted to date me and thinks I'm attractive and intelligent. 

He's intelligent, talented, he's an aspiring musician, he has a stable job, responsible. His personality and musical style is kind of dark and edgy. He mostly plays blues mixed w classic rock and metal. I've told him I think he's really talented and should pursue music further. 

I was never convinced though that we would make a good couple even though he felt otherwise. We have similarities but I've always felt our differences were too big and would eventually cause us to drift a part. He was upset when I stopped talking to him for a year and I dated other people during that time but mainly concentrated on myself. I was going through a self-care phase and still am somewhat. 

Thing is I met him through a guy I was dating. They were more acquaintances and never good friends according to him. This is another reason I chose not to date him even though his ""friend"" ended up playing me. He told me he didnt care that I dated his ""now ex-friend"" and really liked me. 

I'm pretty sure he wrote a few songs about me during the time I stopped talking to him. He always seemed to pine over me is the feeling I got. Eventually I started talking to him again because I felt bad and also because I was getting over another guy and feel bad saying that this guy was a nice distraction for me. 

Eventually I started liking him more, but I feel maybe he's starting to evaluate how I fit into his life. He seems more laxed now that he's dating me. He is very respectful and takes care of me, and thinks highly of me but I get the sense that he's finding out all these little things about me, seeing my flaws more and I get the sense maybe he isnt sure about me.

I feel like he was more in love w the idea of me and created this image of me in his mind than how I actually am. For instance, he thought I was Latina because I have dark features but when I told him I'm half white, half middle eastern ever since I feel like he looks at me different and makes jokes about me being white and learning how to fight. He's also made fun of me a few times when I didnt know something historical. He said he thinks I'm a feminist and that he's an old school type where he thinks men should be the provider but hes not a chauvinist though. Hes very political, and seems very critical of women in general when it comes to lack of intelligence, common sense, superficiality. He seems like a perfectionist always looking for the perfect woman and always seeing flaws in women but the thing is no one is perfect and everyone has flaws.

I'm just afraid that he's going to not like my flaws and bail which would be fucked up because he wanted to date me so bad for the longest time but I always felt he didnt really know me and just loved the idea of me. 

I recently talked to him about my feelings of where things are going. I told him I'm ok w taking things slow and like where things are now. I was surprised when he agreed to it and mentioned that hes sorry if he cant talk to me everyday because hes busy w work but that hes not seeing anyone else either.

,dating_advice,"(LONG RANT)
I never had sex until now because I never felt ready. I spent this past year focusing on myself and finally realised I felt ready. I met this guy from a dating app, he’s absolutely gorgeous and older than me (30), and from the moment we met we had this undeniable sexual chemistry. As a side note, one of the reasons I never had sex was because I don’t get turned easily. There’s a big disconnect with my mind and body. I can be really excited to get intimate with someone and then realise my body said no. And there’s literally nothing I can do about it. It sucks. Sometimes I think it’s because I need to have an emotional connection with someone first or fully trust them for my body to open up, and sometimes I think my body is just messed up. ANYWAY the thing with this guy was that I was so incredibly turned on by him the first two dates that I actually wanted to have sex with him. Which never happens. I have never wanted to have sex with any particular person. Cue the third date and my body said...no. Here’s a rundown of the night: 

- Went to bars, had a great night and great conversation and laughed a lot. I felt really comfortable with him. We didn’t kiss this time until the end of the night in the street, where he told me his apartment is free and I didn’t really think much about it and went along with him. I should have known something was off because this time when he kissed me, it was nice but I didn’t feel anything like the other times. But I ignored it and thought it would come back. 

- Initially i told him I didn’t want to have sex so we spent like an hour dry humping and him fingering me trying to get me off but my body wouldn’t respond, though I don’t think he picked up on that. 

-I kind of felt guilty coming along to his place and not having sex so I tried to get him off as well, but whatever I tried on him he didn’t seem to respond to either. Whether that’s a lack of my skill or a problem with him idk. He complained it hurt when I did certain things so maybe he’s more sensitive than other guys I’ve fooled around with. 

-Eventually I was just annoyed with my body for not responding to anything he was doing and thought fuck it I’ll just let him penetrate me, so I told him he can. I was curious to see if I would feel anything from it or like it. So I decided to go ahead with it. I don’t regret this decision. Didn’t seem like a big deal at the time.

-Spent 5 minutes trying to get him in me because my body was not turned on and was essentially locked.
- Finally got him in, enjoyed my first time being penetrated for all of 5 minutes and then he came. 

- In his post cum bliss state he just wanted to sleep though I asked if we could try again later and he didn’t really answer he just wanted to sleep. 

- I was bummed because I’d spent the past 40 minutes essentially being bored and not knowing what to do while he was trying to get us both off, and then FINALLY for 5 minutes of actual sex, I enjoy it...and then he just wants to sleep. 

- I brushed it off and thought he was just tired cause he’d been hard for ages and had been trying to get us both off for a long time before we’d had penetrative sex. 

- However I hoped after he napped a bit he would wake up and want to fuck me again. No such luck. He just spooned me and instantly fell asleep. 

- I napped for an hour or so then waited for my alarm to go off a couple hours later and left in the middle of the night because I needed to get home because of work the next morning. We barely talked as I got ready to leave, he just seemed really sleepy and still in bliss state. He then walked me out. I gave him an awkward hug and muttered something weird and then went home. 

It’s been almost two days and I haven’t heard anything from him. Our texting history prior to this has been regular but sporadic if that makes sense. So it’s not unusual that a day or two may go by without anything. It’s just I thought he would at least text the next morning or something to check I got home ok or got to work on time or something. But nothing. 

I guess he’s ghosting me because he thinks we’re sexually incompatible. Or I’m bad at sex or inexperienced. Or it was awkward for him too. Idk. I have no idea what he thought at the time or thinks now.

It just sucks because he is a “nice guy” and should know that ghosting someone like this after sex is shitty. So if he is actually doing that it kinda hurts more coming from him in particular because he seems to be the type of guy that would communicate if he doesn’t want anything more. BUT at the same time I replay everything and realise maybe this is all he wanted. He’s older than me and more experienced, maybe he does this all the time and thinks we were on the same page. 

I want to see him again. On an actual date or for sex. I don’t mind. We’re not compatible as anything super serious, but I want to keep him around as he was the first guy in years that had made me feel turned on, even if it was briefly. 

Should I reach out if he doesn’t message me after another day, what should I say? I want to see him one more time and just have an honest conversation with him and tell him I have not had sex that much but want to experience it properly with him? 

OR am I lying to myself and just struggling to come to grips with being rejected and used for sex and being blindsided by someone. I’m really confused. Still attracted to him and still want to give sex with him another shot, but scared he thinks next time will be like this last time (except he just didn’t know it was my first time). Ok I’m done.

,dating_advice,"Hey...so it’s another Friday night and I have no plans. My parents are out. I’m on my couch waiting for my doordash to come. It’s storming and it’s times like these I wish I had a boyfriend to invite over and just hangout and enjoy movies with. I’m 23, female and I’ve never been someone’s official girlfriend. I’ve always wanted to know what love feels like- the kind that isn’t obligated or platonic like with friends and family. These past couple months I’ve actually moved away from focusing on constantly dating and finding a relationship while I made more friends in life. Sometimes your friends are busy so you’re left alone and, I enjoy my alone time, it just becomes overwhelming at times. My sister has always had a boyfriend and I’m tragically single even though I get the typical “you’re so beautiful I can’t believe you’re single” lines and compliments. I take her relationship (and boyfriends) as Lessons and learn from her mistakes which is a perk being an outsider, I just wish I was able to learn on my own too. 

I’m wondering...when did you guys first become someone’s serious partner? Fellas- did your girl ask you out? What made you make things official/serious between you guys? 

Most of the time I date/“talk” to someone for three months maximum and then they either just want sex or we aren’t compatible and I’m not going to settle because I feel like so many girls in relationships do exactly that since a lot of people cheat and stay together. Anyways, is this normal? What advice or steps can I take to initiate more opportunities for dating? I’m a homebody so trying new things on my own can feel really anxiety ridden but I’m willing to change that in the hopes I’ll find someone to enjoy life with :) 

Also I will admit to being pretty intense when I first talk to someone. I like it to be known I’d rather invest my time in dating/finding a relationship instead of hooking up, Guys sometimes like that and we continue to date then they tell me they aren’t right for me but won’t ever really tell me what it is I did to make them uninterested if i ask. It’s getting pretty discouraging and I know I’ll have a good relationship one day- I’m just wondering what I need to do on my end to improve the chances.

Edit: I love myself. I lost 70 pounds on my journey to improve my self confidence and health and I’m in a good place in life. I do have sex with guys I date, but I don’t just want that. I have tinder, bumble and hinge. Why I would be on reddit asking for advice and not those is a weird thing to assume. No, I don’t need to work on how much I value myself.

My sister has always had a boyfriend and I’m tragically single even though I get the typical “you’re so beautiful I can’t believe you’re single” lines and compliments. I take her relationship (and boyfriends) as Lessons and learn from her mistakes which is a perk being an outsider, I just wish I was able to learn on my own too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering...when did you guys first become someone’s serious partner? Fellas- did your girl ask you out? What made you make things official/serious between you guys? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I date/“talk” to someone for three months maximum and then they either just want sex or we aren’t compatible and I’m not going to settle because I feel like so many girls in relationships do exactly that since a lot of people cheat and stay together. Anyways, is this normal? What advice or steps can I take to initiate more opportunities for dating? I’m a homebody so trying new things on my own can feel really anxiety ridden but I’m willing to change that in the hopes I’ll find someone to enjoy life with :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I will admit to being pretty intense when I first talk to someone. I like it to be known I’d rather invest my time in dating/finding a relationship instead of hooking up, Guys sometimes like that and we continue to date then they tell me they aren’t right for me but won’t ever really tell me what it is I did to make them uninterested if i ask. It’s getting pretty discouraging and I know I’ll have a good relationship one day- I’m just wondering what I need to do on my end to improve the chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I love myself. I lost 70 pounds on my journey to improve my self confidence and health and I’m in a good place in life. I do have sex with guys I date, but I don’t just want that. I have tinder, bumble and hinge. Why I would be on reddit asking for advice and not those is a weird thing to assume. No, I don’t need to work on how much I value myself. It’s the other way around- I’m having a hard time finding guys who see me as valuable as I see myself. I’m not a booty call to hang with at night when you’re feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"I apologise in advance for my poor grammar.

I (27M) have been regularly meeting/ talking to a woman(25) who's from India for just over 3 weeks, we met on Bumble. She is doing a Masters at the same University as me. She arrived in my country this August. It is her first time travelling outside of India.

We meet quite regularly, maybe 3-4 times per week I always drive to the other side of my relatively small city to see her at her place. Originally I assumed because she was into dating because she was on Bumble, so I asked her after the 1st week about considering a relationship but she said that she can't commit to someone at the moment because she is doing a 1-year very intensive postgraduate Masters, and in doing so would not allow her to commit to a relationship in a meaningful way that she would like to, and it would also add too much expectation from her during this intensive academic year. I can understand her POV.

I was disappointed by her response originally because I really like her, but then I thought that maybe she's also trying to gauge my character. Since she is from India, I am unsure about how women view men's responsibility when it comes to the opposite sex/dating. Should the man do all the work?  I am still talking to her with the hope that a relationship will happen.

Whenever I go to her place to meet her, she never really invites me inside. Whenever I ask if I shall go inside to her place she always says ""I will come out"", this could be for a few reasons. One reason that I can think of is she is sharing an apartment with 3 other Indian girls which she does not get along with. She's also sharing with 1 of those girls in a 2-Single bedded room.  She showed me her apartment and room once since we met.

I try to be good to her, offering her lifts to do grocery shopping etc. I regularly make hummus for her, although while she always accepts it, she says that I'm ""crazy"" and that I ""do too much"". We went to a restaurant 4 times and she seriously offers to pay for her half but I pay for us both, however, I think I am being silly when doing this.

A few days ago she asked me if I wanted to go out to a bar for a drink together. We went out the following night for 1 drink, she purchased the round of beers. When we were together she didn't dismiss my casual touching of her leg or shoulder when I was joking or teasing her. And she also casually touched me on my chest a few times when joking. The night ended and I walked her home. I gave her a long hug at the end of the night and then I got a taxi home.

However, one thing that I have noticed that she never initiates text conversations with me, I am always the first. But most of the time when she replies, its always just simple replies and then the conversation ends. This confuses me on a number of levels me because this indicates no interest in me as a potential sexual partner/someone she is attracted to. However, when I meet her we either talk in my car or go for a walk, and we talk for 1 to 2.5 hrs about everything and anything. She told me she hasn't had sex yet, even though I never asked, she also told me her fetish, she has told me about her family. She even mentioned that we should travel together( when finished masters). She asked me what gift I would like I would like for Christmas and wanted to go shopping with me.

 I am quite insecure about my looks though, and I never had luck in the pub scene/ dating apps. I know I am not objectively good looking or photogenic. It doesn't help that almost everywhere I look around my university/ city I always see really good looking guys and tt also doesn't help my confidence that I am balding quite badly. 

1 week ago she told me that she stopped using Bumble. I was both surprised and excited by this. I said to her that it's difficult to use it while also studying for her upcoming 6 exams, she said (paraphrasing) ""no, I just don't feel like using it anymore"". I asked her if she's talking to other guys and she said no. Since I met her, we always have great eye contact, but she also said that she has no problem keeping eye contact with people.

We have not kissed yet or held hands, is this due to her Indian background? I don't know. She has told her family about me, they are very liberal and receptive to foreigners. One of her cousins is married to a non-Hindu white guy and there were zero issues.

I always compliment her when we meet, even if she's not dressed up or wearing no make-up.

Yesterday I told her that I like her, She replied that she can't understand why I like her and said ""Thanks for liking me"". I don't know how to feel about this, Is she afraid to express her feelings?

Part of me thinks I'm in the friendzone, yet part of me thinks that I have a chance. Maybe I am doing too much for her or being too nice? I don't know.  I am not agreeing with everything she says or likes, yet we do seem to get along very well together.

I'm sure the answer is painfully obvious from an objective point of view but I am blind to the truth. I don't know where I stand with this girl. Is she playing the long game? Is she just being friendly?  Should I continue messaging her first and continue to organise to meet her regularly?

No matter how busy someone's life is NEVER accept the excuse of them being too busy. I was in a relationship for 4 years, always initiated texts BF  wouldn't reply for hours because he was ""busy"" (we were both students- I worked, he didn't)

NO ONE IS THAT BUSY, IF THEY HAVE TIME TO OPEN A MESSAGE, THEY HAVE TIME TO REPLY!!!! If they're on snapchat and you see their score going up THEY ARE CHOOSING NOT TO TALK TO YOU!!!!

Stop, and DON'T let anyone make you feel like crap. And can we STOP using the EXCUSE of being busy when you've opened a message?! We all get busy but if you can open a message, you can reply to it!

Editing: I'm not saying to constantly message eachother. Being in eachothers pokets is unhealthy! Texting every 5 minutes is unhealthy- besides no one has that many interesting things to say!

But choosing not to reply for a day to a week is ignorant. If you're genuinely interested in someone and only talk once a day- thats fine. If you don't reply for a couple of hours thats also okay. But using the excuse of being ""busy"" when you have replied for over a day is rude and ignorant. And I'm sorry but no matter how many people post but... busy I'm not interested, it's an excuse to not invest yourself into someone.

If someone says ""we talk once or twice a day"" I don't care because thats acceptable. If you were interested in someone and didn't reply for a week because they were busy you'd be vexed right? Right.

Edit 2: I don't think I clarified well enough, I'm not the girl who used snapchat or has anxiety. I don't use snapchat to talk on, and will not use to people on fb or snapchat as contact for anyone I'm interested in.

,dating_advice,"So I'm 22 and I was really shy so I never approached any girl even though I had 3 love interests through my life (my therapist asked me if I was gay or asexual). However on Friday I matched someone on Tinder for the first time after 6 months of swiping, though I superliked her (she looked cute and her bio said she was a nerd so she seemed my type). We talked a bit on what we like and we're having a date in 2-3 hours.

I should have probably asked earlier but the anxiety started hitting just now and I don't know if I'm ready for this. First of all it seems our interests don't align that well after chatting a bit. Secondly she studies law and that might be an issue in the future because I will most probably move to another country and law school graduates usually have a hard time in other countries (or so I've heard). And finally she might be depressed, which I'm also, so it might be difficult to take care of her.

However on Friday I matched someone on Tinder for the first time after 6 months of swiping, though I superliked her (she looked cute and her bio said she was a nerd so she seemed my type). We talked a bit on what we like and we&amp;#39;re having a date in 2-3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have probably asked earlier but the anxiety started hitting just now and I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ready for this. First of all it seems our interests don&amp;#39;t align that well after chatting a bit. Secondly she studies law and that might be an issue in the future because I will most probably move to another country and law school graduates usually have a hard time in other countries (or so I&amp;#39;ve heard). And finally she might be depressed, which I&amp;#39;m also, so it might be difficult to take care of her.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Hi reddit

So this situation involves me, two other guys and one girl, I'm gonna change names to protect identity.

So I, have known Danny (30M), for ten years now since college 2008. While we have fell out of touch once, were friends for life, I care about him. He would come running if I was in trouble, in his words.

Danny has all the feels for Millie (22F), who he met via a friend of hers. M &amp; D work at the same company, but different hours. Problem is, Danny friendzoned himself hard, by just hanging around Millie and never making a move. He's being a classic giver, who gets nothing back, not in a manipulative or creepy way though, he just puts everyone's needs first, to extreme levels.

Thing is, he has had more girlfriends and sexual partners than me, so I know he knows better. For whatever reason, these feelings he has for Millie, has just compromised that. He's not respecting himself.

Millie, by no means takes advantage of this though, she's friends with Danny, but gets uncomfortable with him doing all this stuff for her, saying not to. There's also no way she doesnt know he likes her, but I think she's too scared to reject him, you'll see why.

She is roommates with a guy she has known way longer than Danny, Sam (21M). Millie and Sam go way back, from what I can tell, have been friends and nothing more up to this point. 

Danny, Millie and Sam all hang out every week due to shared jobs and apartments. I met both of them last month, when Danny rang me up to grab beers. They took a liking to me right away and I've been clubbing with the three since and hung out once at Millie &amp; Sam's apartment.

I've had a hard time making friends after uni, so I was happy to be making new ones and reconnecting with my old one.

Here's the thing, I have a crush on Mille too, but nobody knows about it. I came across Millie on Tinder, months before me and Danny reconnected. She's my type and is in the creative field like me, so whenever I reset or reinstalled Tinder, I'd always swipe right if i saw her. But we never matched so I forgot about it.

So when I saw her hanging out with Danny in public, not gonna lie, I got jealous of my friend. Which I felt like an asshole for, over a girl I didn't even know, but not gonna lie, I'm single, I don't want to be, so It is what it is.

It's kind of weird now that I'm newly friends with this girl, who not too long ago, was a Tinder Crush. 

Thing is, me and Millie get on, I make her laugh alot, I'm not saying she likes me too, but I'm not bowing to her like Danny, I'm actually getting to know her legit, having playful banter, not being a 'Niceguy'. 

I haven't said anything because I'm scared of how Danny will react, also I don't want to lose my friend and two potential new ones who have warmed up to me. 

Millie is a lovely girl, who despite her looks is very humble and not malicious and I adore Sam, we have the same Lad energy and fire eachother up when we talk.

The biggest problem here is Danny is in a bad place, is near suicidal and doing drugs when he goes out. He works nights, lives with his grandfather and is his carer, has no other family as they are all too messed up/abusive, then has these feelings for Millie. It's all getting too much for him. 

He's also paranoid that Millie and Sam may be secretly getting together, upset that his friends are hiding it from him. Something that I reminded him he has no authority on and that it's technically none of his business.

I've told him many times, he needs to either tell Millie he likes her and be done with it or accept friendship. That this doing stuff for her thing, will not get her to like him like that. All the while consoling him that he needs to switch to day work and get off drugs, because all these negative things at once will kill him.

Meanwhile i try to process that I'm helping Danny confess feelings to a girl I fancy too. That I may have technically fancied longer than him. I have my own problems to deal with too, my own frustrations and setbacks in dating, the loneliness and self doubt that comes with it.

I'm not perfect, I'm no better than anyone in this square, I'm just trying to approach this right.

ANYWAY

I write all this, because two hours ago, Danny called me at 4AM, buzzed on Cocaine, saying that Sam had just confessed he likes Millie, to her face while the three of them were out earlier. Danny took this opportunity to confront Millie on how she feels about Sam. She just said he's just a friend/couldn't get a straight answer. 

He called me to 'Say goodbye' I talked him down and he said it's just the drugs talking. I'm meeting him for a drink tomorrow, I'm worried about him obviously. But this situation is just blowing up.

We all like Mille, the only person she doesn't know who likes her is me, I'm trying to pull my friend out of rock bottom, over a girl we both like but I've been silent. Millie and Sam now have to have that talk aswell. I'm worried for Danny, scared of losing Sam and Mille in the chaos too. I also feel bad for Millie in a way, it must be awkward for her too. 

My first priority is making sure Danny is not going off the deep end, but I'm still confused about the other stuff.

Do I tell Danny I like Mille too?

Do I tell Millie I like her? Just throw my hat in too.

Do I keep quiet? Bottle my stuff in.

Do I get involved if Danny/Millie/Scott get in a fight.


I need help.",t2_rgyw5,False,,0,False,I (27M) am caught in a crush/feelings/love square. I don't know what to do.,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e7qo3t,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575817055.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi reddit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this situation involves me, two other guys and one girl, I&amp;#39;m gonna change names to protect identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I, have known Danny (30M), for ten years now since college 2008. While we have fell out of touch once, were friends for life, I care about him. He would come running if I was in trouble, in his words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danny has all the feels for Millie (22F), who he met via a friend of hers. M &amp;amp; D work at the same company, but different hours. Problem is, Danny friendzoned himself hard, by just hanging around Millie and never making a move. He&amp;#39;s being a classic giver, who gets nothing back, not in a manipulative or creepy way though, he just puts everyone&amp;#39;s needs first, to extreme levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, he has had more girlfriends and sexual partners than me, so I know he knows better. For whatever reason, these feelings he has for Millie, has just compromised that. He&amp;#39;s not respecting himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millie, by no means takes advantage of this though, she&amp;#39;s friends with Danny, but gets uncomfortable with him doing all this stuff for her, saying not to. There&amp;#39;s also no way she doesnt know he likes her, but I think she&amp;#39;s too scared to reject him, you&amp;#39;ll see why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is roommates with a guy she has known way longer than Danny, Sam (21M). Millie and Sam go way back, from what I can tell, have been friends and nothing more up to this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danny, Millie and Sam all hang out every week due to shared jobs and apartments. I met both of them last month, when Danny rang me up to grab beers. They took a liking to me right away and I&amp;#39;ve been clubbing with the three since and hung out once at Millie &amp;amp; Sam&amp;#39;s apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a hard time making friends after uni, so I was happy to be making new ones and reconnecting with my old one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing, I have a crush on Mille too, but nobody knows about it. I came across Millie on Tinder, months before me and Danny reconnected. She&amp;#39;s my type and is in the creative field like me, so whenever I reset or reinstalled Tinder, I&amp;#39;d always swipe right if i saw her. But we never matched so I forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I saw her hanging out with Danny in public, not gonna lie, I got jealous of my friend. Which I felt like an asshole for, over a girl I didn&amp;#39;t even know, but not gonna lie, I&amp;#39;m single, I don&amp;#39;t want to be, so It is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of weird now that I&amp;#39;m newly friends with this girl, who not too long ago, was a Tinder Crush. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, me and Millie get on, I make her laugh alot, I&amp;#39;m not saying she likes me too, but I&amp;#39;m not bowing to her like Danny, I&amp;#39;m actually getting to know her legit, having playful banter, not being a &amp;#39;Niceguy&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t said anything because I&amp;#39;m scared of how Danny will react, also I don&amp;#39;t want to lose my friend and two potential new ones who have warmed up to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millie is a lovely girl, who despite her looks is very humble and not malicious and I adore Sam, we have the same Lad energy and fire eachother up when we talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem here is Danny is in a bad place, is near suicidal and doing drugs when he goes out. He works nights, lives with his grandfather and is his carer, has no other family as they are all too messed up/abusive, then has these feelings for Millie. It&amp;#39;s all getting too much for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s also paranoid that Millie and Sam may be secretly getting together, upset that his friends are hiding it from him. Something that I reminded him he has no authority on and that it&amp;#39;s technically none of his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told him many times, he needs to either tell Millie he likes her and be done with it or accept friendship. That this doing stuff for her thing, will not get her to like him like that. All the while consoling him that he needs to switch to day work and get off drugs, because all these negative things at once will kill him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile i try to process that I&amp;#39;m helping Danny confess feelings to a girl I fancy too. That I may have technically fancied longer than him. I have my own problems to deal with too, my own frustrations and setbacks in dating, the loneliness and self doubt that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not perfect, I&amp;#39;m no better than anyone in this square, I&amp;#39;m just trying to approach this right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write all this, because two hours ago, Danny called me at 4AM, buzzed on Cocaine, saying that Sam had just confessed he likes Millie, to her face while the three of them were out earlier. Danny took this opportunity to confront Millie on how she feels about Sam. She just said he&amp;#39;s just a friend/couldn&amp;#39;t get a straight answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He called me to &amp;#39;Say goodbye&amp;#39; I talked him down and he said it&amp;#39;s just the drugs talking. I&amp;#39;m meeting him for a drink tomorrow, I&amp;#39;m worried about him obviously. But this situation is just blowing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all like Mille, the only person she doesn&amp;#39;t know who likes her is me, I&amp;#39;m trying to pull my friend out of rock bottom, over a girl we both like but I&amp;#39;ve been silent. Millie and Sam now have to have that talk aswell. I&amp;#39;m worried for Danny, scared of losing Sam and Mille in the chaos too. I also feel bad for Millie in a way, it must be awkward for her too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first priority is making sure Danny is not going off the deep end, but I&amp;#39;m still confused about the other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I tell Danny I like Mille too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I tell Millie I like her? Just throw my hat in too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I keep quiet? Bottle my stuff in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I get involved if Danny/Millie/Scott get in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"So I have been talking to a girl taking the same class as me. I first met her 3 months ago as we sat beside each other in class. Since then, we've been meeting for lunches regularly and having occasional study sessions together. At the beginning, we had texted each other quite a bit, but the frequency of these texts gradually decreased. I had planned to ask her out after our finals ended, just in case things got awkward in the middle of the semester. Recently, I found out from her friends that she has been texting this other guy quite often. On the last day of our finals, I had hoped to ask her out, but she told me she was going out with this guy friend to try some food. I did feel a tinge of jealousy, but of course, I did not tell her about it.

So, finals have finally ended, and I would be flying off for Winter School in about a week, and will not be back until about a month later. So I asked her out for a meal at one of her favourite restaurants before I fly off. Here's the thing: she asked if I could wait till I got back before we had that meal. I didn't asked her why she couldn't make it. 

Based on these information alone, do you think I should still harbour any hope for this relationship to work out, or should I just try to get over her and move on? And if there is still a chance, how should I respond to this? I am currently quite torn here as I have grown to like her a lot the past few months, but I do not wish to waste any time and emotional energy on something which will eventually not work out.

I first met her 3 months ago as we sat beside each other in class. Since then, we&amp;#39;ve been meeting for lunches regularly and having occasional study sessions together. At the beginning, we had texted each other quite a bit, but the frequency of these texts gradually decreased. I had planned to ask her out after our finals ended, just in case things got awkward in the middle of the semester. Recently, I found out from her friends that she has been texting this other guy quite often. On the last day of our finals, I had hoped to ask her out, but she told me she was going out with this guy friend to try some food. I did feel a tinge of jealousy, but of course, I did not tell her about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, finals have finally ended, and I would be flying off for Winter School in about a week, and will not be back until about a month later. So I asked her out for a meal at one of her favourite restaurants before I fly off. Here&amp;#39;s the thing: she asked if I could wait till I got back before we had that meal. I didn&amp;#39;t asked her why she couldn&amp;#39;t make it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these information alone, do you think I should still harbour any hope for this relationship to work out, or should I just try to get over her and move on? And if there is still a chance, how should I respond to this? I am currently quite torn here as I have grown to like her a lot the past few months, but I do not wish to waste any time and emotional energy on something which will eventually not work out. I apologise if I&amp;#39;m being vague here, I am not sure what else to include here. Feel free to ask any other questions.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a fun time at the event, didn't push her to dance when she didn't want to. Eventually, I got her out of her comfort zone to dance to a song that she was interested in and she seems to be enjoying it more and more as time went on. She had originally stated that she felt out of her comfort zone but didn't seem like it by the end. I felt we were having a good night. After getting off the party bus we were on I walked back with her to the dorm we both live in and she grabbed my arm to hold the whole way back. I was at this point wanting to kiss her for the first time really bad. Her roommates, however, happen to appear while walking her back to her dorm. This was unfortunate timing. So I went back to her room and talk with her friends and her for a while. Eventually, she wanted to change out of her dress so instead of what she normally does which is hug me in the room or where her friends are right there. She took me outside to say goodnight. So I thought this was perfect timing as her roommates were no longer an issue. And she seems as if she wanted us to be alone to say goodnight. So when we went to say goodnight I put my hand on the side of her face to go for it, however, she seemed to go for a hug. So I don't know if she isn't ready or if I was too pushy, or maybe just was a miscommunication. Whatever it was I suck at the first kiss and I need advice, this was the first time I had really tried to go for a kiss other times it was really awkward or was initiated by the girl. I have tested the waters with kissing her on the cheek and she responds well to physical touch. Idk if she is as affectionate as I am, but tonight she seems more willing to be hands-on as well. 

I don't mind waiting but I really want to kiss her. She is really beautiful. But I also want her to be comfortable, but it seems that I obviously don't know what that looks like and if she wants to kiss me.

,dating_advice," So I've(19M) been liking this girl(19F) for a while now, but I didn't want to say anything because that might ruin the friendship. After a while, I started noticing some stuff she did like giving me an origami heart(she could have made any shape, why a heart?), sitting next to me and putting her arm on my shoulder, playing footsie under the table, smiling and eye contact, so I start thinking that she likes me too and that I have a pretty good chance with her.

So basically I've been thinking about an ex classmate lately. We were in the same class last year, and I've always found her really cute. She often complimented me on how beautiful I am, that I could be a model and this sort of stuff. When we were just the two of us, I usually felt a nice vibe from talking to her. 

But the thing is, last year I was in a relationship and by no means wanted to cheat on my ex girlfriend so of course I didn't try to flirt I was just being friendly because she was a cool girl. 

Now I'm single and a few days ago I decided to follow her on IG. She followed back and I liked the only pic she has, but since there are still my ex's comments on my profile she probably thinks I'm still in a relationship.

,dating_advice,"I met a guy during the summer who I immediately hit it off with. We were both interested in something casual and that was fine with me. Our interactions in person always had something more to them: we would share a lot of intimate details about ourselves, our fears, we would cuddle each other after many sessions (high libido and all that), he would comfort me when I was visibly upset and he seemed to care for me. He quickly became one of the few people I felt like actually gave a shit about me.

There was only one problem. He's a super bad texter.

And when I mean a bad texter, I mean, he wouldn't get back to me for days at a time. Just scheduling meetings, which were about once a week when we started uni again, was difficult. This isn't, however, exclusive to me. Many of his friends and his family know this struggle with him as well.

I didn't think I was falling for him, but I did. I'm not 'in love' with him by any means, but I had feelings for him and I wanted something more serious. 

Before I voiced this, there came a period of time where he was constantly busy, so much so that he'd been blowing me off for a month. I started to lose hope in any of this working out, so I started using Bumble again and looking for other guys. It seemed like every single encounter was another nail into the coffin telling me 'I'll never find a guy like him again'. Of course, I know this is bullshit, and it's not like he's perfect by any means. But I had guys sexually harassing me and being assholes left and right. And mind you, I don't vet guys on appearance or jobs or whatever most people vet their matches by. I vet very closely on personal beliefs etc., and I STILL managed to land myself in the pits of despair.

I wanted to talk to him in person, but since it'd been impossible to see him up until now, I made a last ditch effort to tell him how I felt.

He didn't reply to me. I thought this might awaken some urgency in him, but it didn't. After a week, which was the longest he's ever not responded to me, I doubled down on attempts to find others. I had come to the conclusion that the Original Guy had just ghosted me so I was trying to move on.

I thought I found a guy who was perfect. So much in common, shared values (which was the most important to me), and his place was much closer to me. We talked for like a week before meeting up. Up until now, I had avoided sleeping on the first date, and that intention remained the same when I met with him. However, after 2 hours of talking about everything under the sun and feeling we had a real connection, I decided I wanted to go to his place. It was loud in the bar we were in and I wanted some closeness - not necessarily to sleep together, but I did want to.

Well, it went downhill from there. I was nervous, I was losing attraction, I didn't feel that comfortable. I was saying dumb things, I was out of my comfort zone. He wasn't pressuring me, but he also wasn't actively reassuring me it was okay if we didn't do anything. At this point, it had been two weeks since the Original Guy had not replied to me, and guess what? By divine intervention, like some sort of telenovella plot, he texted me shortly after I arrived at the guy's place. Not to actually address what had been said, that would be too much to expect, but to ask if he could 'properly get back to me' the next day. I didn't say anything and just put my phone aside.

I guess that definitely put me on edge, but there were other things that led to my discomfort. I decided that before I left the bar I wanted to sleep with him so I may as well get on with it - and pretty much had the worst sex of my life. I wouldn't even say it's because he was bad at it. It was my first time being completely naked (I'm not comfortable with my body), the couch was being a nuisance (he had suggested we go to his bed but I had stupidly refused) and the cherry on the cake was when he used lube that made me feel like I just got an allergic reaction unexpectedly and without warning.

I left pretty quickly. 

The night had ended badly for me, and for him as well I imagine, but I wasn't intending on ghosting him. I thought, well there were a lot of circumstances that led to things going badly, maybe after discussion we could work through this and try again. I had especially told him twice that I wasn't looking for a one night stand and he assured me of the contrary.

Well, the following morning, he had unmatched me and blocked my number. 

Original Guy has not gotten back to me either, five days later.

I feel like utter shit. I can't sleep properly at night, my exams are coming up, I have depression to begin with and I spend my days studying / working on assignments and sleeping the rest of the time. I feel lonely and have nothing good for me beyond my future academic success which feels like it's for nothing because I'm unhappy to begin with.

I feel like if the Original Guy finally gets back to me it's just going to be rejection. I can't think of any excuse being good enough that I sweep this under the rug but at the same time I'm desperate to hear what he has to say.",t2_2splg15n,False,,0,False,Ghosting Woes Vent,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e7k0p8,False,dark,,public,20,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,20,,False,,1575757472.0,,[],[],{},,True,,1575781898.0,text,3,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met a guy during the summer who I immediately hit it off with. We were both interested in something casual and that was fine with me. Our interactions in person always had something more to them: we would share a lot of intimate details about ourselves, our fears, we would cuddle each other after many sessions (high libido and all that), he would comfort me when I was visibly upset and he seemed to care for me. He quickly became one of the few people I felt like actually gave a shit about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was only one problem. He&amp;#39;s a super bad texter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I mean a bad texter, I mean, he wouldn&amp;#39;t get back to me for days at a time. Just scheduling meetings, which were about once a week when we started uni again, was difficult. This isn&amp;#39;t, however, exclusive to me. Many of his friends and his family know this struggle with him as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think I was falling for him, but I did. I&amp;#39;m not &amp;#39;in love&amp;#39; with him by any means, but I had feelings for him and I wanted something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I voiced this, there came a period of time where he was constantly busy, so much so that he&amp;#39;d been blowing me off for a month. I started to lose hope in any of this working out, so I started using Bumble again and looking for other guys. It seemed like every single encounter was another nail into the coffin telling me &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll never find a guy like him again&amp;#39;. Of course, I know this is bullshit, and it&amp;#39;s not like he&amp;#39;s perfect by any means. But I had guys sexually harassing me and being assholes left and right.

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;#39;m not really good at this. Never really asked anyone out. I have social anxiety (not massive, but stuff like this). Really, I dont want to be wrong about my assumptions and turns out she just wants to be friends, and make it awkward between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? How should I go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Hey! 

I met this girl called Kristy on Hot or not and we agreed to talk more at a coffee shop. This was my first date after not using any dating apps for a long time. 

Lookwise she’s an 7/10. Only thing that I don’t like is that she has piercings in her nose. However it’s not bothering me.

She is also taking birth control pills which suprised me because I thought she had sex without condom. She was honest and told me that she had sex with a guy from tinder a year ago. 

Not only that but she told me right away that she wants to have a relationship. 

This is what I know from talking to her:

1. Her favourite color is black and gold. 
2. She likes to hit the gym in her freetime
3. She works at a interior store
4. She likes to eat Pizza and chicken. (Has never tried sushi)
5. Her parents are divorced
6. She likes to listen to KPOP music
7. She likes Drama movies and series. 
8. She has had sex at a age of 20 (she is 21)
9. She don’t know what to do after she’s done studying.

,dating_advice,"(I'm M30, seeing F26) I've been seeing this girl for a good 8 months, (16 in total, we split for a while). She came into my life when I was half way through some serious weight loss (~110lb), and she was the first woman in a while to show me any attention. Naturally we hit it off. Things were great. But as I got fitter, she remained plus size.. She's always asking to eat take out, go drinking, etc, and I just don't find her physically attractive. That said I do still like her, she is a great friend, but there's no sexual nor romantic interest anymore. 

Now, I'm at the end of my weight loss, I'm in the gym an hour or more everyday, eat healthy, semi-jacked, and I'm a completely different person. This has come with a lot of attention from much more attractive women. I know it's what's on the inside that counts, blah blah blah, but is physical attraction too much to ask for? 

I feel like the right move is to break up with her, carry on with my new lifestyle, as see what happens. But I don't want to lose her as a friend either. I know this is a ""have your cake and eat it"" moment. And I feel awful that appearance is playing such a large part in the decision.

She came into my life when I was half way through some serious weight loss (~110lb), and she was the first woman in a while to show me any attention. Naturally we hit it off. Things were great. But as I got fitter, she remained plus size.. She&amp;#39;s always asking to eat take out, go drinking, etc, and I just don&amp;#39;t find her physically attractive. That said I do still like her, she is a great friend, but there&amp;#39;s no sexual nor romantic interest anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m at the end of my weight loss, I&amp;#39;m in the gym an hour or more everyday, eat healthy, semi-jacked, and I&amp;#39;m a completely different person. This has come with a lot of attention from much more attractive women. I know it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s on the inside that counts, blah blah blah, but is physical attraction too much to ask for? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like the right move is to break up with her, carry on with my new lifestyle, as see what happens. But I don&amp;#39;t want to lose her as a friend either. I know this is a &amp;quot;have your cake and eat it&amp;quot; moment. And I feel awful that appearance is playing such a large part in the decision. &lt;/p&gt;

ok so i was training at the gym next to a girl and i started a conversation with her about the songs at the gym and it happened we both like the same band.

we started saying hi every time we see each other and sometimes when we are training near each other we open topics mostly short ones because i don't want to bother her. she goes to the gym 7 days a week i go 4 days.

after one week i think or two weeks i asked her for her if i could add her on social media i told her ""you seem really nice can i add you on social media?"" so i gave her my Instagram and she added herself from mine.

first for a week we talked a lot and then i asked her if she is single she said yes and i asked her if she is free she said she is busy because of new year and Christmas. but she might be free after new year. i told her i asked her if she is free so we go out to a restaurant which she also knew it and we talked about that restaurant.

anyway after two days from this conversation she replies but one hour after or two hours but she does reply at the end also she says she is busy.

friends at the gym told me she was checking me out at the gym i didn't even notice.

now i am not sure what to do i don't want to look needy at the same time i don't want to lose her.

should i stop sending he messages for a while? give her space? or text light conversations? or text her between days?

I'm fairly new to this platform and honestly, i really just made this account to ask for advice. To cut the long story short, there's this guy and we used to talk every single day. Eventually he confessed his feelings for me which I happily returned however it didn't really last all that long. Unexpectedly, later he contacted me and asked whether I could give him another chance. Of course I did but I can't and won't lie that I regret my decision. I should've just said no or said it when I had the chance but it seems that I've fallen pretty deep down the rabbit hole.

My current situation is pretty much torture. Especially for someone who overthinks every single little thing.

,dating_advice,"I recently started putting myself out there after 22 years of not doing so. y’know, going out with friends, dating women. I’ve worked on myself a lot and I finally feel good enough to do it, which feels awesome. But I have a problem, and I was hoping y’all could help me.

I’m finding that the platonic parts of dating are really easy for me because I’m a good conversationalist and I try my best to be a good friend to everyone I like. But the part of dating that is really challenging for me is the sexual part. I’m not a sexually active person (I’m a virgin), and I tend to view myself as demisexual in the sense that I think hooking up or casual sex is only worth it if I actually connect with the woman on an emotional level.

I can connect easily with women on an emotional level because of my conversation skills and humor, but once it becomes clear that a move of some kind should be made, I kind of... trip over my own feet. The feelings I get when aroused are too strong for my brain to cope with, and I get very... awkwardly silent. Couple that with my view that it’s rude to express interest or get touchy with women because it objectifies them and I ultimately shut myself down, no matter her interest level. Date ends, and we never speak again.

I think my problem with my sexuality is I just can’t justify expressing my desire to be sexual because I feel it is an inherent objectification of women, and knowing that that is a patently sexist thing to do, I decide I can’t justify showing that desire. I see so many other guys do this, where they immediately put their hands all over a girls body and I feel a little gross just watching.

My thought process goes: “oh, you want to touch her? Kiss her? What if she really doesn’t want you doing that? She’s just being nice. She doesn’t really want you. Don’t ever get handsy because there’s a slight chance she’s going along with it just to appease you because you’re a man and she’s afraid you’ll kill her if she says no! Don’t do it, don’t be a predator like those other guys!!”

Anyway, that’s my main challenge. Thanks for listening to me.

Tl;dr I’m afraid of being like the other guys who mistreat and take advantage of women and I basically suppress my own sexuality for what I feel is “the greater good.”",t2_4sc4vt,False,,0,False,I (23M) can’t justify expressing my sexual interest in women,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e7kisf,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575784239.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently started putting myself out there after 22 years of not doing so. y’know, going out with friends, dating women. I’ve worked on myself a lot and I finally feel good enough to do it, which feels awesome. But I have a problem, and I was hoping y’all could help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m finding that the platonic parts of dating are really easy for me because I’m a good conversationalist and I try my best to be a good friend to everyone I like. But the part of dating that is really challenging for me is the sexual part. I’m not a sexually active person (I’m a virgin), and I tend to view myself as demisexual in the sense that I think hooking up or casual sex is only worth it if I actually connect with the woman on an emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can connect easily with women on an emotional level because of my conversation skills and humor, but once it becomes clear that a move of some kind should be made, I kind of... trip over my own feet. The feelings I get when aroused are too strong for my brain to cope with, and I get very... awkwardly silent. Couple that with my view that it’s rude to express interest or get touchy with women because it objectifies them and I ultimately shut myself down, no matter her interest level. Date ends, and we never speak again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my problem with my sexuality is I just can’t justify expressing my desire to be sexual because I feel it is an inherent objectification of women, and knowing that that is a patently sexist thing to do, I decide I can’t justify showing that desire. I see so many other guys do this, where they immediately put their hands all over a girls body and I feel a little gross just watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thought process goes: “oh, you want to touch her? Kiss her? What if she really doesn’t want you doing that? She’s just being nice. She doesn’t really want you. Don’t ever get handsy because there’s a slight chance she’s going along with it just to appease you because you’re a man and she’s afraid you’ll kill her if she says no! Don’t do it, don’t be a predator like those other guys!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s my main challenge. Thanks for listening to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr I’m afraid of being like the other guys who mistreat and take advantage of women and I basically suppress my own sexuality for what I feel is “the greater good.”&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"So I'll start with a little bit of a back story... me and this girl started dating about 2 years ago, it was about half way through my senior year in high school and her junior year. We started dating after a year of texting and talking. We hit it off right away and didn't rush into doing anything and both of us were completely okay with that. Anyway our relationship was what one would define ""perfect"".

 Now obviously the honeymoon phase lasted about 4 months but we were still extremely happy together after that for quite some time. Just recently(about 3 months ago) she started acting a little strange and I understand that she had a lot going on in her life such as college, private problems in her life, friend issues etc and ofcourse I was always there for her and always made time for her. We actually hung out a lot and I believe that may have been the problem... 

I quickly became like a part of her family, her parents adored me, her brothers loved me and even her aunts uncles and grandparents loved me.. well anyway back to about 4 months ago.. she started acting strange and getting upset very easily over things and having a lot of mood swings. She would get short fused with me very easily but I always knew it wasn't me so I never took it to heart and I never(and believe me) never yelled back at her or anything, it's just not how I am. 

Even with this going on we still hung out a lot and had great times together, laughed smiled, made jokes, got romantic, the whole 9 yards.. well then about a month ago she started texting differently, acting even stranger and just telling me to stay home and give her space. Eventually after asking I was told that she needs space and feels smothered by me even though I'm ""literally perfect"".

 So we were still together at this point and I said okay, completely understandable I know she has a lot on her mind and just needs alone time. About 10 days go by and we hangout again, nothing was different, we were 100% normal, we got into the swing of things and hung out for about 2 weeks on and off days until one night after a great time at the movies she randomly gets really upset about something and without saying anything goes to bed angry ignoring me.. okay..? So I texted her the next morning at work and told her I love her and what not and asked what's the matter once more, and I get no reply... about 3 days go by of no replies and I see her at work and ask her and she told me she thinks we need a break.. so I start to get very upset and we talk.. she told me by break she meant just more space and so I gave it to her once again.. another 10 days go by and now I ask her if she wants to hangout and she says ""no"". Okay I understand I'll just wait it out.. (this entire time waiting I'm very anxious and worries).

 So anyway that same day she texts me and asks me if I can give her a ride somewhere and I did, we got lunch and did the things she needed to do, I brought her home and asked if she wanted me to stay and she said ""not tonight"". So at this point I was pretty happy because the night went really well... or so I thought? She kissed me goodnight, said she loved me and I left to go home. 

The next day we hangout and have a fucking blast together.. then the next time I text her around noon and get a lot of stale replies and so I asked her if everything was alright and she replied ""yes""... So I'm walking down the stairs at college to leave and I see her walking up them and I obviously say hi and stuff and she looked extremely upset... I asked her what's wrong and she just said ""I have a test I need to go"" in a very upset voice... I asked her later that night if she was okay and she said she was fine and she just hasn't been feeling herself and she can't tell me why... so the now the next day comes and I'm very worried and not wanting to lose her.. I'm in my car waiting for class to start and she texts me, seems like she's in a very good mood, hanging out with her girl friends and having a good time. Awesome! Well I get out of class and I open her text and she asked me if I wanted to get lunch and so I agreed and we met at a Chinese restaurant... we ate, laughed smiled, and what not for over an hour and a half.. 

I knew she had to work later that night so I was going to just go home and well she asks me if I want to hangout in her car for a bit and talk before she needs to work and this was not unusual because we have done this many times in the past, I agreed and we did. About 15 minutes in she brings up why she's been upset.. I had to tell her a few times she can tell me anything and well she told me this: she feels like she hasn't been herself, she says that relationships(all kinda not just ours) aren't working for her right now... she said she still loves me so much and she still has a lot of strong feelings for me and that she doesn't want to break up with me... she says that she needs to come to terms with changes that have happened to her over the last 2 years and she feels like since we've been together during that time that she can't if we're together.. she kept mentioning how her friend broke up with his bf and after 4 months they got back together and are better than ever... 

The thing is I didn't want this.. I love this girl and it broke my heart into pieces when she told me this.. she and her family still wants me to come over and she still wants me in her life.. the thing is I don't know if I can do that emotionally... I want her back.. part of me feels like she didn't want to do what she did.. and her mom and dad both believe she'll come back.. all my coworkers were shocked because we were never unhappy together.. my friends were shocked, my parents.. everybody.. Does anybody have any kind of advice for what to do to possibly get her back or insight as to what this means.. I love her more than anything and just want things back to normal.. this just happened the other day btw... sorry if I jumped information I tried to include as much as possible...

,dating_advice,"So started talking to a girl through one of the various dating apps and she lives quite a fair way away (Hour and half drive). Had a great first couple of days of chatting and then it died down a bit until she dropped a few hints about going out together. I suggested we do something in the coming week and she said that'd be good and the conversation sort of picked up again because it gave me a feeling of her being interested.   


The conversation slowly deteriorated again until Thursday night and she asked me what I was doing this weekend and beat around the bush a bit before inviting me out to a party in her town. Then comes Friday Saturday where I felt like I was being messed with because she kept saying she didn't want me to drive the whole way just to see her (we obviously have no mutual friends and she's a bit younger than I am so I just thought it was her getting cold feet). Got really drunk Friday night and sent her a whole message saying I feel like I'm getting the run around and probably best we just not waste each others time then that afternoon she sends me a message saying party is still on if I want to go. So I'm like *fine whatever* let's see what this girl is all about and if in person our conversations aren't so shit.   


Get there, feeling extremely nervous that this whole thing is going to be a massive train wreck. Picked her up to go to the party, get there and none of her friends are there so she asks if I just want to drive around with her for a bit before she goes home. At this point of 10 minutes into talking, conversation was already great and there was heaps of back and forth banter. Everything just seemed to click in person. So 2 hours go by and I've got all the signs of a good date. Lots of inside jokes, lots of chatter about everything. She's actually asking me questions now which seems to never happen when we're messaging each other. She's said she's never talked so much on a date before and usually just makes the other person talk. Hinted to a second date, planned to go to a B&amp;S Ball at the end of next month. You get the point.   


So fast forward next day I don't really message her at all, tell myself I'm not doing the chasing anymore and I get nothing until I send a message asking how her camping trip with her family is going (usual shit, catch any fish ect) Conversation starts up again but it's just back to normal like she's a completely different person *in person*.

I suggested we do something in the coming week and she said that&amp;#39;d be good and the conversation sort of picked up again because it gave me a feeling of her being interested.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation slowly deteriorated again until Thursday night and she asked me what I was doing this weekend and beat around the bush a bit before inviting me out to a party in her town. Then comes Friday Saturday where I felt like I was being messed with because she kept saying she didn&amp;#39;t want me to drive the whole way just to see her (we obviously have no mutual friends and she&amp;#39;s a bit younger than I am so I just thought it was her getting cold feet). Got really drunk Friday night and sent her a whole message saying I feel like I&amp;#39;m getting the run around and probably best we just not waste each others time then that afternoon she sends me a message saying party is still on if I want to go. So I&amp;#39;m like &lt;em&gt;fine whatever&lt;/em&gt; let&amp;#39;s see what this girl is all about and if in person our conversations aren&amp;#39;t so shit.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get there, feeling extremely nervous that this whole thing is going to be a massive train wreck. Picked her up to go to the party, get there and none of her friends are there so she asks if I just want to drive around with her for a bit before she goes home. At this point of 10 minutes into talking, conversation was already great and there was heaps of back and forth banter. Everything just seemed to click in person. So 2 hours go by and I&amp;#39;ve got all the signs of a good date. Lots of inside jokes, lots of chatter about everything. She&amp;#39;s actually asking me questions now which seems to never happen when we&amp;#39;re messaging each other. She&amp;#39;s said she&amp;#39;s never talked so much on a date before and usually just makes the other person talk. Hinted to a second date, planned to go to a B&amp;amp;S Ball at the end of next month. You get the point.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fast forward next day I don&amp;#39;t really message her at all, tell myself I&amp;#39;m not doing the chasing anymore and I get nothing until I send a message asking how her camping trip with her family is going (usual shit, catch any fish ect) Conversation starts up again but it&amp;#39;s just back to normal like she&amp;#39;s a completely different person &lt;em&gt;in person&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this all just dead in the water at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"So me and this girl used to work together. We started in the same orientation and over a few months got really close(as friends since she had a BF) since me and her worked together exclusively almost daily. We talked about literally everything. Nothing between us from both of our lives were off limits over the time i ended up developing feelings but keeping it to myself and wanting to be the friend she deserved. I didnt wanna ruin that especially since she had a man anyway. Things really made me click with her when I gave her a ride home one day and she started crying hysterically over the issues between her and her BF. She went over everything he doesnt do or doesnt like to do and things she wishes he would do. All I would think about is how I could give her everything she wants in a man if i ever had a chance with her. Well fast forward to today and i havent worked at the same company in almost 6-8 months. Shes been single for a while and because we dont work much anymore we kinda dont talk much anymore. Im at a point now where I seriously want to ask her out in some form but my mind is questioning the best route. So maybe some of you amazing people can help me with this step. I was debating on sending a lengthy message explaining how ive been feeling over the past year and mentioning the car ride where we broke down, and just everything on my mind and what not regarding her. Another thing I was debating was just messaging her says ""Hey ___ random and definitely unexpected for you but ive been debating/wanting to do this for a while and was wondering if you wanted to get together sometime"".

,dating_advice,"Recently I’ve matched with this guy on Bumble and we’ve had this great conversation going on that has been going on for 2 weeks. He gave me his number the same day we matched. He did send me photos of his family and of his trips. He would talk about his future plans and even mentioned what our 2nd and 3rd dates would look like. 

Overall a seemingly likable guy. 

He did say that if he ever did enter a relationship, he would want to be independent and valued his friends and family. He also was not afraid of double texting or using emojis. He told me that I made his Thanksgiving break and would ask me questions about myself. He has a great sense of humor too so I suggested that we meet up for a date this Sunday.

So I started texting a guy off Bumble(kinda like tinder, but more geared towards people who want to have a relationship) and we have had a few conversations on the phone too. He seems like an interesting person. And he seems to be good looking and definitely way out of my league. Even then, he is interested in talking and frequently initiates conversations and phone calls.

A few weeks back, I was at a colleague's party. I rarely go to parties, in fact this was my first party since I relocated to this city. I knew no one there other than that colleague and I was making conversation with different people. One girl told me that she worked at my date's company a few years back. I told her that I knew someone there and she asked me his name which I then told her. She said he is a really sweet and charming guy.

What a small world! His company and neither mine is a big one so it was a surprise that on the first time I go to a party, I meet someone who knows him. I told the same to him and he seemed ok at the time. A little critical that I had talked to that girl, but at the time I thought he was that way was because he must have thought that I am doing background checks on him. I clarified that I wasn't, it was just a coincidence.

Yesterday, during a very confusing conversation, he poked me saying that he thinks we should invite her too and that we should all have lunch at his place?? I was a bit surprised and I told him that since it was the first time we were meeting, it would be better if we met in public. And he said that this wasn't a date, it was friends meeting. I said fine, we can do that but we should meet out in public. He said we should invite her because she is my ""bestie"". I told him that I had a 4 minute conversation with her a few weeks back, how does that make her a friend.

Super confusing. Later on, he did say that he was joking and that it was just the two of us out on a date.

Further he keeps trying to say that he isn't looking for love and when I agree that it's alright, I am not either, he back tracks.

So I met this girl from hinge and we texted for a little bit before deciding to meet up. We set up a date this past Sunday and we scheduled to meet up at 9:30pm, 1 hour and a half after she gets out of work. I get out the gym and head home to get ready and wait for our date. She’s a nurse and works 12 hour shifts. So I get a text from her around 7:15 and she says that she has to cancel because she’s work a ton and she’s super tired and feels sick. She’s apologetic about it. We then talk about rescheduling later on next week and she says she has Thursday and Friday off but her sister is coming into town to visit her. I tell her it’s not a problem at all, if you want to go out either of those days I’m down but I’m not trying to take away time from you or your sister. We can always schedule for the week after. She says that sounds like a good option! I’ll let you know. :) and we left it at that. 

It’s been a full week and I haven’t heard from her since and am not expecting her to reach out to me anytime soon if at all. But I just wanted to ask for any feedback on the situation and if I handled this well. I’m not planning to contact her again until she reached out first. But again, I’m not expecting anything.

I also don't know exactly how I feel about him. I'm a little uncertain and this is the first time I've gone this long and far with someone without being giddy and pretty infatuated.

I know that nerves aren't uncommon but they are cripplingly bad when it comes to making a move or letting a girl know how I feel.

It also really frustrates me because it's the one area of my life that I'm not actually brave. I genuinely get over nerves so easily and push on with what I'm doing in every other situation but I just can't here and I don't know why.

To be honest I don't even know what advice I'm asking for here because I really don't know what to expect beyond the usual ""you just have to do it"" advice but I'd rather put it out there that cling to the knowledge and not tell anyone.

We had good conversations about music and movies and philosophy stuff, felt like we had a lot in common and there was chemistry going on so he asked me out that night, which I made excuses because it was too fast. We exchanged numbers and continued good conversations for about a week.
Then we finally went out, we watched a not that good movie and we were both a little bit awkward but after the movie he was very active to make the date going. So we spent a whole day together most of the time we were talking, he really made efforts and in the end he did say we have good time and start to suggest ‘the next time’.
He was just so nice we are from different culture and he was very willing to learn about my culture which was kinda touching, he sang song we heard during the date which I said I liked a lot for me. The second date was even better, he even suggested some future todo list. Everything just seemed so perfect almost tooo perfect. 
I actually liked him and just felt so lucky to met such nice guy in my first off line date. After the second date he suddenly texted me saying how he likes me and likes having me around but he’s insecure about if he was doing good because he’s kinda ‘shy and awkward’. The message was so sincere and I was moved. And I think I really started to opened up my mind for him since then.
He did suggested a third date very soon which I really couldn’t make it so just declined. Then he started to show stronger sense of insecurity (said he might be too clingy and stuff) which did kinda make me uncomfortable and I couldn’t help to tell him that. This was our first so called conflict, but after that everything seemed smooth as usual. We didn’t see each other for abt a week and I actually started to miss him. During this week we talked everyday he even made plans for Christmas and winter break which surprised me a little but I did kinda looking forward to those.
So yesterday he asked me out although he had flu and stayed up all last night. I suggested him to get some sleep before meeting up and he promised to wake up in a reasonable time although I said just get enough rest long as we can make it before the event closed. And then he ended up overslept and we totally missed the whole thing. Which I was totally fine with it if he made apologies and explain a little, but he didn’t, just some very simple words like ahh emoji I should have stay up and then just didn’t reply for an whole hour. So I got a little bit angry and couldn’t help asking for an apology, and he did apologized,  not very sincerely, I told him how I feel, he said sorry again and I did told him nevermind.

It feels like being punched right on my chest. I felt breathless and couldn’t concentrate in any other things. I really really want to just text him and request for a clear answer like ‘Can I know what happened’ or ‘Everything ok?’ but I know I probably shouldn’t. I just can’t believe it because it just felt so right and I just don’t want to give it up.

,dating_advice,"Kind of confused about this guy (21M), he was in one of my classes this semester, but now it's final exams so I haven't seen him for a week or two. Anyways, he showed a lot of signs of interest and I feel he initiated contact in class like extremely eye contact (i'm talking for most of a 2 hour class), waiting for me after, asking someone to switch seats so he could next to me, etc. I don't think I was reading the signs wrong - he didn't act the same toward me as other girls in the class, and 2 of my friends in the class thought he was interested in me. 

But in the few occasions we've talked online, just a few messages back and forth either about school or our week so far, we might have a 2 message conversation. If he does respond, he'll respond very fast. Or we respond to each other's stories, but when I respond to his, he at most does the heart like or just on read. Although my final response isn't a question, I still feel 1 or 2 of them have had some grounds for response. 

I sent him a brief message earlier today asking about a class we are both taking next semester (which when I told him I was taking it like a week ago, his face lit up), yet he left me on read. Part of me wants to let the current situation slide given that it's final exams, but he seems to be into social media so I really don't know how to interpret this.  The way I kind of think of it is that even if I was interpreting all these signs wrong and he just thinks were friends, I wouldn't leave my friends on read.

Anyways, he showed a lot of signs of interest and I feel he initiated contact in class like extremely eye contact (i&amp;#39;m talking for most of a 2 hour class), waiting for me after, asking someone to switch seats so he could next to me, etc. I don&amp;#39;t think I was reading the signs wrong - he didn&amp;#39;t act the same toward me as other girls in the class, and 2 of my friends in the class thought he was interested in me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the few occasions we&amp;#39;ve talked online, just a few messages back and forth either about school or our week so far, we might have a 2 message conversation. If he does respond, he&amp;#39;ll respond very fast. Or we respond to each other&amp;#39;s stories, but when I respond to his, he at most does the heart like or just on read. Although my final response isn&amp;#39;t a question, I still feel 1 or 2 of them have had some grounds for response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent him a brief message earlier today asking about a class we are both taking next semester (which when I told him I was taking it like a week ago, his face lit up), yet he left me on read. Part of me wants to let the current situation slide given that it&amp;#39;s final exams, but he seems to be into social media so I really don&amp;#39;t know how to interpret this.  The way I kind of think of it is that even if I was interpreting all these signs wrong and he just thinks were friends, I wouldn&amp;#39;t leave my friends on read. &lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"The immediate motivation for this post was a situation yesterday, where I finally went on a date with a girl after we'd been texting multiple times a day for three weeks. She'd seemed really interested, we'd had lots of sexually explicit texting, and it seemed like a foregone conclusion, given her statements, that she'd come to my place for dinner after coffee.  However, our date was initially made awkward by the fact the cafe I picked didn't seem to exist at the location Google Maps had it, and we wandered around for a few minutes talking. Not knowing what to do, I suggested maybe we sit down under the shade of a tree in a nearby street, or she could come back to my place and sit outside there as she had indicated she was planning to do that anyway. (In hindsight, I wonder if she felt creeped out by either of those). She suggested finding another cafe, and we went there. However, after sitting down for barely 5 minutes, she received an obviously fake phone call and left.   

I'm used to dates where after an extended time it seemed apparent that we weren't really clicking. But this was by far my shortest date, with someone who I'd probably talked to more than anyone else before meeting.

An obvious explanation is that she just didn't find me attractive in person as she did in photos for no controllable reason, and she didn't want to waste any further time, and maybe that's all it was and I can't change anything about it. 

But I'm worried that my behaviour somehow caused it. Perhaps the non-existent cafe and/or my behaviour immediately afterward creeped her out.  Or given there was a presumption of sex, she probably felt more panicky about aborting the date than we not implicitly planned that. Or maybe I'm just awkward in person - I definitely feel that, as someone who probably spends more time writing online than talking with real people, my online persona is smoother than my real life one.

----

A similar situation has happened before - a girl who was super interested in sex to the point she was basically begging me to come over to her house lost interest after a coffee date. However, a couple of other times it's been the opposite  - I had a girl come home with me after what I thought was an extremely awkward date, and another time a girl seemed interested in a second date after I thought we didn't click at all and I might have come across as socially inept.

So it's not the case that I'm deterring everybody. But I do wonder how much it's worth ""learning"" from any one date. On the one extreme, I could write any loss of interest off as always inexplicable and out of my control, but that might cause me to neglect consistent mistakes.

She&amp;#39;d seemed really interested, we&amp;#39;d had lots of sexually explicit texting, and it seemed like a foregone conclusion, given her statements, that she&amp;#39;d come to my place for dinner after coffee.  However, our date was initially made awkward by the fact the cafe I picked didn&amp;#39;t seem to exist at the location Google Maps had it, and we wandered around for a few minutes talking. Not knowing what to do, I suggested maybe we sit down under the shade of a tree in a nearby street, or she could come back to my place and sit outside there as she had indicated she was planning to do that anyway. (In hindsight, I wonder if she felt creeped out by either of those). She suggested finding another cafe, and we went there. However, after sitting down for barely 5 minutes, she received an obviously fake phone call and left.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m used to dates where after an extended time it seemed apparent that we weren&amp;#39;t really clicking. But this was by far my shortest date, with someone who I&amp;#39;d probably talked to more than anyone else before meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious explanation is that she just didn&amp;#39;t find me attractive in person as she did in photos for no controllable reason, and she didn&amp;#39;t want to waste any further time, and maybe that&amp;#39;s all it was and I can&amp;#39;t change anything about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m worried that my behaviour somehow caused it. Perhaps the non-existent cafe and/or my behaviour immediately afterward creeped her out.  Or given there was a presumption of sex, she probably felt more panicky about aborting the date than we not implicitly planned that. Or maybe I&amp;#39;m just awkward in person - I definitely feel that, as someone who probably spends more time writing online than talking with real people, my online persona is smoother than my real life one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar situation has happened before - a girl who was super interested in sex to the point she was basically begging me to come over to her house lost interest after a coffee date. However, a couple of other times it&amp;#39;s been the opposite  - I had a girl come home with me after what I thought was an extremely awkward date, and another time a girl seemed interested in a second date after I thought we didn&amp;#39;t click at all and I might have come across as socially inept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not the case that I&amp;#39;m deterring everybody. But I do wonder how much it&amp;#39;s worth &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; from any one date.

,dating_advice,"So I (17m) recently got added on Snapchat by a girl who’s in my gym class but who I’ve never had a class with before and have really interacted with in real life (aside from the occasional gym class activity). I add her back, and she then makes me one of her streaks (again, this is really our first interaction of any kind)

Here’s how the interactions generally go on a given day:
She sends a snap that says “streaks”, then I send a snap back of some random object or something, and then she snaps back to just me (I assume) with a picture of the top of her forehead or a random object or the ceiling or occasionally her face (without text). If she sends a picture that I have a reason to comment on, I reply with a picture with text, and then she’ll typically reply with a picture an text response. (Note: she has not yet been the one to initiate a conversation)

Today, we sorta had a conversation, and while she didn’t necessarily actively carry the conversation, she responded in ways that gave the conversation somewhere to go, rather than just a generic response like “nice” or no response at all that would have basically ended it.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years. We’re living together for the next month while she gets herself situated. The breakup was amicable and she definitely saw it coming. 

I won’t get into details but I had brought up an issue we were having in our relationship many months ago and let her know that if things didn’t change I would be ending our relationship. So nothing changed and here we are. I know I went about this in the best way possible because we would have an argument about it almost every 3 months. After we would argue she would promise to change and try again. She would try for about 4-5 weeks and then we were back in the same place. This had been going on since March of this year and I ended our relationship a few days ago. Now we’re still living together until she moves out.

My question to you r/dating_advice is, how do you deal with being single after so long ? I constantly feel like I’m throwing away 6 years and it makes me want to take everything back and try and work things out, even if I know it’s not what’s best for me.

,dating_advice,"I have explained this a little bit before with a similar post, but I’ll explain some of it again, just to give some context.~

I (20M) have been friends with this girl (19F) for a few months. She is a Japanese exchange student at my school for this current school year.

We first met while I was being a help for the international kids at my school. She was shy at first, but ultimately we ended up being close. We spent time basically cuddling for four hours, listening to music, and talking about each of our lives, and our interests, and our favorite types of music and so on. 

We often spent a lot of time with each other after class, hanging out and talking about our day and goofing off. She would practice doing whatever she was doing and I would watch videos, or just watch her play. I would also enjoy texting each other all day, and all night even though we would spend most of our time together. It was really nice, and it made me happy, as I never really had that before her.  She ALWAYS sits next to me, sometimes sitting on my lap, or laying on my lap or whenever we were out with friends, I would always hold her hand, and lead her behind me.  

After some thought, I told my friends and some of our mutual friends that I liked her, but wasn’t planning to confess. They all looked at me confused as to why I wasn’t going to confess, and some where confused even more, as they thought we were already a couple. 

I told them that I didn’t want to as I was scared to confess, as maybe I got the wrong idea, and thought maybe it was just a cultural thing, and maybe she just found us as close friends. I started thinking and thought maybe I’m stressing too much about cultural differences, and maybe she did like me? Although if I confess, and she turns me down, I don’t want to lose her as a friend, as to something she may have found culturally acceptable in Japanese culture, if that makes any sense? 

Has anyone experienced anything like this before? What’s the best way to go about it? I feel like I’m stressing too much, but I’m not sure.

&lt;p&gt;We often spent a lot of time with each other after class, hanging out and talking about our day and goofing off. She would practice doing whatever she was doing and I would watch videos, or just watch her play. I would also enjoy texting each other all day, and all night even though we would spend most of our time together. It was really nice, and it made me happy, as I never really had that before her.  She ALWAYS sits next to me, sometimes sitting on my lap, or laying on my lap or whenever we were out with friends, I would always hold her hand, and lead her behind me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some thought, I told my friends and some of our mutual friends that I liked her, but wasn’t planning to confess. They all looked at me confused as to why I wasn’t going to confess, and some where confused even more, as they thought we were already a couple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told them that I didn’t want to as I was scared to confess, as maybe I got the wrong idea, and thought maybe it was just a cultural thing, and maybe she just found us as close friends. I started thinking and thought maybe I’m stressing too much about cultural differences, and maybe she did like me? Although if I confess, and she turns me down, I don’t want to lose her as a friend, as to something she may have found culturally acceptable in Japanese culture, if that makes any sense? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone experienced anything like this before? What’s the best way to go about it? I feel like I’m stressing too much, but I’m not sure. I had a similar experience while studying abroad in China, but ended up being wrong because of cultural differences. Anything helps. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"I \[M26\] like the new girl at the barbershop. Her dark features charmed me straightaway, and in the first moment of eye contact, I thought we had an awkward pause - that sort of flint-stroke in the night - as with people who have a mutual attraction. We made introductions and it turns out she's named for a tree-borne fruit (or the fruit is named for her? But it couldn't be as sweet. I'll keep the corny lines to myself). She showed me to the barber's chair and asked what I wanted done. Do you like it longer in the back? I don't know, I said, I can't see back there. She laughed.

&amp;#x200B;

She wasted no time in disarming me with her curious, soulful personality - launching into a conversation about meditation, self-reliance, social responsibility, books, language. She's not afraid of the deep waters. If I wasn't already a bashful dork, her candor and sincerity would have soon had me simpering like a schoolboy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now guess how old I am. \[Note: I never got an answer but she looks 20-something.\] We shared a few laughs. She told me how nice it was to have a deep conversation for a change. When I went quiet for a moment, she asked what I was reflecting on. If you could have seen us, you would have rolled your eyes. She was coming on so strong, I had to ask her. So once she finished the haircut I forgot I was getting, she handed me a business card with the shop's phone number on it. But I asked if I could have hers instead.

Oh, I don't give it out, she said.

You could pardon my mistake, since there really seemed to be every sign of playful flirtation. Maybe there was? Maybe she thought it unprofessional to give her number at work? Maybe she's married.

&lt;p&gt;P.S: I unfollowed my former crush&amp;#39;s social media and muted all her activity till the end of time lol. Maybe it&amp;#39;s me being petty or whatever but hey, I got to do what I got to get to her out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily bet in a few days she&amp;#39;ll just be another memory in the back of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I gave it a shot, so... 🤷🏼‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Hi

I like this girl in my lecture, and I barely speak to her. She has a bunch of friends, and I am too shy to speak to her. I spoke to her 3 times total. 2 of them were pretty decent conversations at the beginning of the semester, and I asked her a question in one of my lectures about a topic. Yes, I am extremely shy. 

I'm not good looking, so I have low self esteem, and I compare myself to others a lot. My esteem is so low, a lot of times when people say nice things I think they are messing with me. A girl in middle school a few years back asked if I wanted to go to the dance with her, and I couldn't say anything because I was thinking she was trying to fool around with me, and I didn't want to embarrass myself if I said sure. It might because of my friends that said that I have no chance with girls or that they have a better chance than me at getting girls.

So, yeah. The girl in my program( I shouldn't say lecture, since the semester is practically done, and I'll have to try to talk to her next semester), I really want to talk to her, but I don't want it to be like I'm hitting on her.

,dating_advice,"Hello everyone! I've been lurking around for a couple of weeks and today alone I've seen a few posts that seemed like people were talking to me. I decided to tell my story. Maybe someone out there has some advice.

Please be aware that this is a really long post. I really felt like painting the whole picture here so that people can understand where I'm coming from. Also, be aware that english is not my first language. There's a TLDR at the end.

So, there's this girl I work with. She works at the HR. It's not that big of a company but we are placed in physically different rooms in the same floor. From the beginning, I always thought she was pretty but that was it. For a couple of months, this turned into a crush.

I've always been someone very focused at work. And I also suffer from major anxiety and some form of social phobia. Because of that, throughout the years I've skipped many company wide parties, many happy hours. Usually I don't even celebrate my own birthday and I won't allow people to find out about it. I've also been skipping many pictures that people try to take because I'm really unhappy about my current weight and all.

So, I believe in the eyes of people who I don't talk to, I'm a hard introvert. When it comes to work topics I'm fine. I can talk and discuss anything. Talk to anyone. I only freeze in some other situations.

I've been trying to change things for a while. Never succeeded. Now, from the moment I realized I liked this girl and I decided to take action, everything changed. I managed to start a diet and eating healthy food. I started talking more with people and going out even when I know I won't be able to talk as much as everyone else.

I've only talked to her pretty much about work stuff in very short interactions. I knew that if I was feeling something I was probably projecting something onto her. But I wanted to find out if she was the person I thought she was. I wanted to find out if I like talking to her or if I like like her.

I came up with many plans, including throwing her a surprise birthday party at work. She (and everybody else at work) never expected me to put so much effort in something for her (and something that involved talking to a lot of people, restaurant reservations, choosing and picking up the cake and so on). She was very grateful and ever since I have opening to talk to her.

I became very anxious about trying to find things to talk but talking about random stuff at work is hard. Everyone's always busy. I managed to go have lunch with her once and it was amazing, one of the best days I can remember. All this made me more anxious to be with her and talk with her more. I do my best to give space and not try to talk all the time so I don't become obnoxious (even though anxiety is hitting me hard all the time).

At some point I asked her out but as two people that go out to talk. I wanted an opportunity to talk to her about life stuff so I can get to know her and find out what is it that I'm feeling. To my surprise she agreed. But she ended up canceling on the very day we had agreed upon, literally 5 minutes before the time we chose.

Since then I tried calling her for lunch, having coffee a few times but she always has plans. Of couse I thought she was avoiding me. But every now and then she tells me how we still have to set up a date for us to go have a cup of coffee. So, maybe it's just a coincidence. But yeah, that got me very frustrated. Not being able to talk to her is terrible for me.

For every attempt, I spend days without mentioning it again and even without talking to her at all.

This year I even celebrated my birthday there. Was greeted by many people, invited quite a few for a celebration lunch. There I managed to sit right in front of her but anxiety took the best of me. I couldn't say a word to her. In fact, I think I think I didn't talk at all while we were there. I was so worried about finding what to talk to her that I ended up not talking at all. In the end everyone was going back to the office and I took a different path. For some reason I thought that by not talking to her I had lost all my progress. There's this voice in my head that keeps telling me that if all is lost, I have to make sure it is really lost. So, I took a different path than everyone else. They got worried about me dissapearing in the street. But I was wandering around just trying to make sense of something.

Recently, for the year-end company party I was one of the first to accept the invitation. This was one more action I was trying to change that introvert image I think I've got and be seen specially by her that I am not really that person she think she knows.

The day before the party, anxiety was kicking in. That voice in my head was telling me that I was doing all that for nothing. That she would never be interested in someone like me, that I was a failure and I should just give up. Everything this ""voice"" says seems so real. I was devastated. I changed the party invitation to ""decline"".

The party was in the afternoon and everyone would work in the morning. We were all there and I told people I wasn't going to the party later. Everyone could see something was bothering me. I was sad because I decided not to go and even more because supposedly I decided to give up on her. Eventually someone told her that I wasn't going. She called me to talk and asked me what was happening. I couldn't tell her the real reason. Anxiety was maxing out. I know that I seemed disturbed and sad. I couldn't tell her. She thought I didn't want to stay in the party 'till late at night and suggested she could make it so that the first part or the party to end earlier. I told her that my decision had nothing to do with the time. She wanted me to tell her what was happening. but I said I couldn't. She asked me if I was sure and I confirmed after hesitating. I couldn't stay at work and left. She messaged me saying she was not upset with me and said we could go for a our cup of coffee when I get better.

The next day I was devastated. I spent all day sad without talking to people. I crossed paths with her but she didn't say anything. She saw me, looked the other way and moved along. Now that just broke me. To think of a world in which I can't talk to her is impossible. And I started trying to get over these things in my head.

Today I'm almost over that last crisis. I've apologized to her for how I was but we haven't really talked ever since. I realized that one of the things bothering me is that I never told her how I feel. And I don't want to not be able to talk to her.

Before I ask what I want to ask, let me tell you a couple of things:

You may read this and think I'm trying to be someone else to impress her. That's not the case. The reality is that I believe we are both very different people. But there are quite a few things she likes that I just don't do out of fear. This anxiety just shows up and makes my life a living hell, making me think a lot of bad things about myself.

Also, I really do not know a LOT about her. For all I know she could even be seeing someone. She keeps her private life private. I think she only shares this kind of things with two people from work, her closest friends. This is also why I want to talk to her more and possibly outside of work. She certainly won't open up while being there. She is a likeable person, and I see more people inviting her for events outside work but it is very rare for her to go. She cancelled on other people from there before.

Lastly, I really do not know what is it that I feel for her. And I really wish I could find out. I would be naive to call it love or whatever. Most of the time I think about her it's always about that feeling I had when we had lunch together and talked about a lot of things.

Now after all that, what I want to ask:

1) I think I'll be asking her for lunch or for that cup of coffee in the coming week. I think I have to tell her about this anxiety things. I didn't mention before but she majored in Psychology. She surely understands what I'm going through. At this point she already saw me like that twice (that I can remember). I think telling her is good thing. It's not like keeping that will have her think I don't have problems. I'd have to omit the part related to her, I guess. What do you think?

2) I really don't want to regret never telling her how I feel. The problem is, I don't even know what it is. What I want to do is at some other time ask her for lunch again or something. And I want to tell her that I like her but I'm not sure exactly what it is. And that I'd like for us to have more opportunities to get to know each other not only so I can find out how I feel but also because she could start feeling something aswell. And in the worst case scenario we would become friends. What do you think about this aproach?

Ps.: originally I wanted to tell her I like her after losing more weight. I'm far from my goal and I think this could be a problem. It's not like she is a super model. It's just that I really think I'm not good looking enough to be with her anyway. My anxiety won't let me be patient. If I don't tell her how I feel my opportunities to talk to her will be very little and still somehow attached to our workplace (in my opinion, I could be wrong though).

Everyone could see something was bothering me. I was sad because I decided not to go and even more because supposedly I decided to give up on her. Eventually someone told her that I wasn&amp;#39;t going. She called me to talk and asked me what was happening. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell her the real reason. Anxiety was maxing out. I know that I seemed disturbed and sad. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell her. She thought I didn&amp;#39;t want to stay in the party &amp;#39;till late at night and suggested she could make it so that the first part or the party to end earlier. I told her that my decision had nothing to do with the time. She wanted me to tell her what was happening. but I said I couldn&amp;#39;t. She asked me if I was sure and I confirmed after hesitating. I couldn&amp;#39;t stay at work and left. She messaged me saying she was not upset with me and said we could go for a our cup of coffee when I get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I was devastated. I spent all day sad without talking to people. I crossed paths with her but she didn&amp;#39;t say anything. She saw me, looked the other way and moved along. Now that just broke me. To think of a world in which I can&amp;#39;t talk to her is impossible. And I started trying to get over these things in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m almost over that last crisis. I&amp;#39;ve apologized to her for how I was but we haven&amp;#39;t really talked ever since. I realized that one of the things bothering me is that I never told her how I feel. And I don&amp;#39;t want to not be able to talk to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I ask what I want to ask, let me tell you a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may read this and think I&amp;#39;m trying to be someone else to impress her. That&amp;#39;s not the case. The reality is that I believe we are both very different people. But there are quite a few things she likes that I just don&amp;#39;t do out of fear. This anxiety just shows up and makes my life a living hell, making me think a lot of bad things about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I really do not know a LOT about her. For all I know she could even be seeing someone. She keeps her private life private. I think she only shares this kind of things with two people from work, her closest friends. This is also why I want to talk to her more and possibly outside of work. She certainly won&amp;#39;t open up while being there. She is a likeable person, and I see more people inviting her for events outside work but it is very rare for her to go. She cancelled on other people from there before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I really do not know what is it that I feel for her. And I really wish I could find out. I would be naive to call it love or whatever. Most of the time I think about her it&amp;#39;s always about that feeling I had when we had lunch together and talked about a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after all that, what I want to ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I think I&amp;#39;ll be asking her for lunch or for that cup of coffee in the coming week. I think I have to tell her about this anxiety things. I didn&amp;#39;t mention before but she majored in Psychology. She surely understands what I&amp;#39;m going through. At this point she already saw me like that twice (that I can remember). I think telling her is good thing. It&amp;#39;s not like keeping that will have her think I don&amp;#39;t have problems. I&amp;#39;d have to omit the part related to her, I guess. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I really don&amp;#39;t want to regret never telling her how I feel. The problem is, I don&amp;#39;t even know what it is. What I want to do is at some other time ask her for lunch again or something. And I want to tell her that I like her but I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly what it is. And that I&amp;#39;d like for us to have more opportunities to get to know each other not only so I can find out how I feel but also because she could start feeling something aswell. And in the worst case scenario we would become friends. What do you think about this aproach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps.: originally I wanted to tell her I like her after losing more weight. I&amp;#39;m far from my goal and I think this could be a problem. It&amp;#39;s not like she is a super model. It&amp;#39;s just that I really think I&amp;#39;m not good looking enough to be with her anyway. My anxiety won&amp;#39;t let me be patient. If I don&amp;#39;t tell her how I feel my opportunities to talk to her will be very little and still somehow attached to our workplace (in my opinion, I could be wrong though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introvert guy likes active girl from work. Guy suffers from social phobia and anxiety disorder. Guy goes through anxiety crisis at least twice in front of her. Guy tries to give up but realize he doesn&amp;#39;t want to live with the regret of not telling her how he feels. Should he tell her about suffering from anxiety disorder? Should he tell her how he feels about her?&lt;/p&gt;

To be very honest, I am at a loss as to how to even begin to ask for advice let alone make any changes. Part of me feels like it's just very late in the day and as I am not unhappy being single, maybe I should just accept that love is not something that is going to happen for me.

,dating_advice,"So, yesterday I started talking to this girl who I’ve seen around before and she’s incredibly cute and funny and nice. I finally got her snap when I did went up and talked to her, which was pretty embarrassing but it paid off. So we were snapping steadily for a couple hours and everything was going pretty good. We were both engaged in the conversation and I was psyched. At some point in the conversation, she snapped me, and then sent me a snap that wasn’t for me immediately after that. Then she sent me another snap where she apologized for the second one and she seemed pretty embarrassed I guess. I responded saying that it was cool and that I do that all the time and I asked what she was doing. After that, she didn’t open my snap for 4 hours, and then when she did she said she was at a recital.

,dating_advice,"I've been contemplating this post for a long time, I guess the basics really are a cry for help. I'm a 29 YO male. I'm average looking, on the skinny side, and suffer from some pretty bad depression and anxiety. I've been single for 9 years now, and I've only ever long-term dated one girl, who tremendously broke my heart.

For the longest time, my life has been in chaos. School, career changes, huge life events... for a long time I've found an excuse to justify remaining single, but as I get older and older I am realizing that they are nothing more than excuses, and I don't really know why I am single...

I spend 90% of my free time playing video games. I spend the rest of my time working. So obviously I could make time for a relationship... but the crux of my problem is that I really don't want to? But it's not that simple. I \*want\* a girlfriend. But not enough to put the effort in. If this sounds silly, keep reading, because if it ended there I would have a solution (Just try to get a girlfriend, silly) 

I've tried online dating so many times. Sometimes I'll match with someone and if I'm very lucky, actually have a decent conversation with them. I \*always\* lose interest in them so fast. I cannot keep myself interested in anyone I meet. It seems every other week my desire to be in a relationship waxes and wanes. Sometimes I just want to be alone forever... and then a few days later, I feel intensely lonely.

 I don't feel normal. In-person, I can make friends at work well enough but I just never seem to even make connections with girls, despite trying to be friendly and smile more. Despite that, I do feel that it's easier for me to be attracted to someone I meet in person... online is so detached.

Nobody seems to be interesting to me. Often I compare everyone I meet to my old ex, despite that being nearly a decade ago now.  When I meet a girl that might like me I instantly find all the flaws in them before anything that I like. I don't know how to be less negative.

And that's just the normal stuff. Once I'm talking with someone and flirting gets sexual, my own desires take hold and my particular kinks make me feel super weird. I'm very into sexual jealousy, and the moment I do care about someone, I can't help but imagine them being taken away from me. This is what happened with my ex, and I wonder if it's related. Is this just how I am now or is it something I can and should change? It feels more like mental damage than just a kink. I just don't know what's normal. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to be attracted to someone anymore.

I guess after writing all this I just feel more messed up and weird. I used to be super insecure about myself (Particularly my skinniness) but nowadays I just don't care about anything... maybe I'm just super depressed and it's affecting my desire for romance?

,dating_advice,"So I (M21) have  been seeing this girl (F20) who got out of a long relationship 6 months ago. She commutes to my college so it makes hanging out with her difficult. We hang out whenever we can but mostly inviting her to my fraternity’s parties. We’ve hooked up a few times and I think I want to try dating, but I told her that I’m not trying to push her into a relationship so quickly after her last one.

,dating_advice,"I went on a date with a guy I met on Tinder earlier this week. I've used dating apps before but it was my first time using Tinder, his first time online dating in general. He messaged me first because we had the exact same music taste and we hit it off right away. After 1-2 days, I asked him out and he said yes.

We met up for brunch since he had to work in the evening. I wouldn't say it was the *best* date ever since I was pretty nervous and a little awkward, but I thought it went well. He was very talkative and I made him laugh a couple times. I really liked him, but I wasn't fully sure how he felt about me.

After we ate, we were walking down the street and I gave him the opportunity to leave early if he wanted to, but he didn't take it. So we sat in a park nearby and talked some more and, when it was time for him to leave, he kissed me. It wasn't a full on makeout session or anything, but it was nice (ok it was REALLY nice). I hadn't expected him to.

After that, he told me to add him on Facebook, so a few hours later, I did. We texted a bit, but I felt like I was mostly carrying the conversation. It was a little bit like that before we met too, but I thought maybe he's just one of those guys who suck at texting?

He told me he thought the date was ""really fun"" so I suggested we go out again. I asked him if he was free Saturday night (tonight) and he said he already had plans. He didn't offer an alternative right away, and even changed the subject briefly, so I thought maybe he wasn't interested and I didn't bring it up again. But then he apologized for not being free on Saturday and asked if I was free Sunday instead. I asked if Sunday night would be okay, since it's final season and I didn't feel I could afford to lose an entire day of studying. That's when he said ""no need to stress then, we can always figure something out next week or something"", which kind of threw me off because I said I *was* free on Sunday, just in the evening, so I didn't really understand his response. I told him sure, that there was no rush, thinking he wanted an out. And then he replied saying ""I'll let you know what's going on for me Sunday evening, I should be free, but I'll keep you posted"".

After that, we texted here and there a little. Again, I felt like I was carrying most of the conversation though. After a while, I got tired of trying to come up with fun things to say, so I just stopped texting him. The last thing I sent him was a screenshot of my Spotify wrapped with his favorite band in my top artists, to which he simply replied ""hell yeah"", so I didn't have much to say to that. That was Thursday and he hasn't said anything since.

I wanted to see if he'd reach out at all about Sunday, but it doesn't look like he will. And I had a feeling he wasn't serious about going out again since he hasn't even asked about what we'd do, unlike when we planned our first date. If he is free by default, as his message suggested, then I don't understand why he couldn't commit to saying yes for Sunday.

I don't want to force something that isn't there. But I've never had a guy kiss me (100% initiated by him) and not want to see me again at all after. I wouldn't even have assumed he liked me, hadn't it been for that kiss. I thought that was a definite sign he was at least interested, combined with him asking me to add him on Facebook, meaning he wanted to keep in touch + the fact that he paid for my meal at the restaurant. Did he simply change his mind? I know he had a somewhat serious relationship end maybe around August or September, so I don't know if that may have something to do with it.

I feel like I gave him a few outs but he still made it seem like he wanted to meet up again, he was just very non-committal about it.

I'm just mad that I let myself get so excited about this. It's been over 2 years since I've been excited about someone. I felt like a school girl with a crush. I couldn't stop smiling for days because of him. It was the first time I met someone I actually had something in common with too (music). I never meet guys who like the same things I do.

Is it worth texting him at all? If so, what should I say? He doesn't strike me as the socially awkward type at all, so I doubt he just ""sucks"" at these things.

,dating_advice,"This Summer we met at a pub, went home together.

I was going through a bit of ""hot girl summer"" phase after a rocky start to the year. I woke up and didn't actually expect to hear from him. Needless to say, the playful banter we had that night continued. We continued to talk daily when I went on a trip. Hiked, explored the city, and drew an amazing picture of my dog and had it framed. He did preface on the first date, saying he was separated for almost a year and has two young boys. He says he hates her, but is in it for the kids. And I do believe there is some serious tension. But said whatever decision they make (to stay together or not) would be for the kids

I'm very laid back and provide a stark contrast from what his wife sounds like. But I always kept one foot in and one foot out knowing he could get back together with her. But i feel conflicted. After I heard a month ago that she has made a request of financial disclosure (not sure if thats a correct term, but listing your personal financial statements), he talked about getting a townhouse in another place. Keep in mind, he's not a big talker, and I don't pry, so when he does say something I do believe him; I mean I've never laid an ultimatum. He did say she still wants to give it one last try and he doesn't but sort of shrugged it off.

Then I found her instagram. She's an influencer with 40k followers. The pictures are just of her and the two young boys. I've always taken his words at face value since I didn't pressure him to talk. But it seems like the last minute conferences have been her traveling with him. Though she doesn't post of him. And she doesn't know he's seeing someone else.

I got involved in this based on the the information I was given. I'm not upset with him, he said she wanted to give it a shot, but trying to figure out whether I should take a step back, say something. Part of me feels icky being involved when I know they're taking a stab at it. It just seems to change a lot. I can't wrong him since he said SHE wanted to take another shot, but is traveling with her on his ""work"" events lies by omission or am I out of place questioning this?

,dating_advice," Hey guys. Please help me to understand this situation.

Background: I met this girl at college last semester. We became good friends very quickly. I liked her and thought she liked me back for many reasons. The semester ended and I decided to ask her out over text message. Our text conversation went like this:

*Me: Hey! I liked meeting you this semester. I think you are really cool. Would you like to go on a date with me next weekend ? We could go to eat something. I´d invite you of course.*

*She (one week after): I´m so sorry. I´ve been so busy these days. This internship is killing me! I need vacations already xD.  You wanna invite huh ? I´ve been craving sushi lately :p .*

*Me: Cool. Are you free next Saturday ?*

*She: I have classes in the afternoon until 6pm*

*Me: Great. Let´s meet at XXX.*

*Me (Saturday noon): Today at 6 ?*

*She(around 6:30pm): My class just ended xD.*

*Me: Oh. So late... Are you still up for the date another day ?*

*She: Yeah sure ;).*

*Me (two weeks after on a Friday night): Hey, wanna do something tomorrow?*

*No response…*

*Me (two weeks after on a Monday night): Hey, how are you?*

*She: Hey. I´m good :) What about you ?*

*Me: Me too. What are you doing next weekend.*

*She: Mmm. On Friday I have classes until 9pm, and on Saturday I think I´m going to the gym maybe.*

*Me: I was wondering if you were up for something. We could go to eat something or wherever you would like to go….*

*She(next morning): It depends… I´m gonna ask my friend at what time are we going to the gym. I´ll let you know.*

*Me: Ok.*

*She(Friday night): Hey. It seems I´m not going to the gym tomorrow xD. Are you still free tomorrow ? Would you like to the music festival at XXX? It seems it´s gonna be very fun. I really want to go there….*

*Me: Yes of course. But I think it´s on Sunday.*

*She: You´re right xD… my bad.*  

*Me: I got nothing to do on Sunday anyway….*

*She: Cool. Let´s go then :)*

*Me: Sure :)*

*Me(next day): Hey, at what time are we meeting tomorrow? It´s ok at 5 ?*

*She: Hey, it seems I won´t be able to go. I´m sorry. Something came up. Gonna be busy tomorrow night.*

*Me: Oh, That´s ok. If you have time we can go to the movies in the afternoon :D.*

*She: Well. I don´t like going to the movies that much….. I prefer outdoor activities :).*

*Me: Oh. Didn´t know that. Have you been at the XXX park at the other side of the town? There are plenty of things to do there. There is AAA, BBB and CCC.*

*She: Oh yeah? It sound very fun :D.*

*Me: Yep. If you want we can go there next weekend.*

*No response….*

After that, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend, and that he was a guy she had introduced me to him but had never mentioned he was her boyfriend.

Since we met again in person we haven´t talked about our text conversations. However, she´s the one always approaching me to say hi and talk since then.

,dating_advice,"I'm a guy in my early twenties. And I've noticed that in life... The opposite sex is far friendlier to me than my own. I have guy friends and whatnot, but in general, guys aren't all that friendly to other guys unless they know them (at least in my experience). If I go out to a department store, for example, female staff are far more willing and happy to bend over backwards for me as opposed to male staff members. They're far friendlier as well.

Now, keep in mind, my country doesn't use tips (this isn't the US). So nobody has any incentive to be as nice to you as possible... But even if this were so this would only incentivise men to be nicer and more perseverent with me surely.

There are some exceptions and some guys will always just be indiscriminately friendly no matter who it is. But in general, I find my own sex to be far more nonchalant and indifferent towards me than the opposite sex. It really doesn't matter where I go I've observed this just about everywhere. I'll go into a Subway and the male clerk will serve me with the absolute bare minimum in customer service. No smile, no enthusiasm, no remote interest in me. **And to be clear:** This isn't a complaint at all. Just an observation. But the moment I get a female clerk they'll be incredibly bubbly, chirpy, and start chatting my ear off. The difference is night &amp; day. Turn the tables, though, and male clerks become incredibly enthusiastic when serving female customers. The same goes for female clerks serving female customers — far less animated and interested.

I'll give a brief example. Today I went into a Subway (I've only been to this one once before and that was a month ago). Anyway, I was immediately served by some guy who seemed like he just wanted to get me over and done with so he could go back to doing his other jobs. I completely understood and didn't take it personally. He asked me what I wanted and I answered and let him get to it. The entire process was completely silent with no fraternising whatsoever. Towards the end, it started to pick up, so some girl appeared from out the back to come and help him. She went to put me through the till and as soon as she looked up at me just gave me the biggest smile like she was so happy to see me. She starts making conversation... And I realised she recognised me from a month earlier because she starts teasing me going, *''You must really like your coffee and Subway''*. 😂 (Because I was holding a cup of coffee a month prior also when ordering my sub). But it surprised me that someone would remember such a small thing and even feel the need to mention it. A guy would never do this (even if he did notice).

I'm not saying the girl liked me. But I do find the difference in behaviour intriguing.

,dating_advice,"So ive been in a relationship for almost 2 years, broke up with my ex gf [20F] 1 month ago. She was being very manipulative and I didnt feel happy anymore, so I pulled the trigger. I dont know why, and I feel bad about it, but only the first 2 weeks were extremely difficult and lately im doing pretty well. 

Now my ex had a friend, they were not best friends, met only once or twice in these 2 years, and lately ive been thinking about that friend. Would like to have a conversation with her or maybe even a date. 
Now there are couple of problems that I see.

1. Obviously shes an ex’s friend, and she knows and are friends with my ex’s other friends.
2. She probably doesnt know that i exist xD although I know her instagram and facebook.

She was being very manipulative and I didnt feel happy anymore, so I pulled the trigger. I dont know why, and I feel bad about it, but only the first 2 weeks were extremely difficult and lately im doing pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my ex had a friend, they were not best friends, met only once or twice in these 2 years, and lately ive been thinking about that friend. Would like to have a conversation with her or maybe even a date. 
Now there are couple of problems that I see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously shes an ex’s friend, and she knows and are friends with my ex’s other friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She probably doesnt know that i exist xD although I know her instagram and facebook.&lt;/li&gt;

,dating_advice,"So, I (F24) was in an almost 3 year very serious slightly long distance (2/3 hours away) relationship (M30) until I was dumped a day before our 2 year anniversary. If I’m being honest, there definitely were signs that he was unhappy months leading up to the break up. Short fuses, reducing time spent together, always angry, almost no affection initiated and distancing himself. But I thought it was him going through a life crisis. (He commented on how he wasn’t happy with his health choices.) 

But during the week following our anniversary, we got into a disagreement and he blew up, I apologized, but he canceled our plans to see each other that night (which we have never done to each other as we value our time together greatly). I was very saddened by it so I ignored his call later that night. I was very distant after as I was disappointed at what he did compared to how small the fight was and canceled our plans to spend the weekend together. Our communication went from constantly throughout the day to almost nothing. I needed my space to process what happened and thought that he needed space as I thought he felt suffocated by me. 

He made plans to meet a day before our anniversary and I thought this small fight would blow over once we saw each other. As most of our fights usually did. I didn’t hear from him that day and asked to confirm that he was coming. He told me no and that’s when my stomach sank. He dumped me over text and told me that he was breaking up with me. He told me that he wasn’t in love with me anymore, that he wasn’t sure that I was what he wanted, and kept repeating that I had to love myself. I went over to his place to talk to him in person and he just kept repeating that he was done with me and that he wished I tried harder from the beginning. I took all of what he said to heart and became a pathetic mess. 

I spent weeks going crazy, crying all the time, trying to contact him to change his mind, spending time with his family who consoled me on the break up, trying to replace the pain with anything. He ended up blocking me on everything and I as revenge did the same. I was a mess and everyone knew it. I found out very shortly after the break up (within days) he joined a dating app and started liking photos of mutual (very pretty and single girl) friends. This and other actions he did, showed me that he was planning this for a while and was most likely talking to a girl while he was dating me. (Not sure if he cheated or not, but from his actions it’s evident that he had someone else.) The break up hit me harder since for months he was telling me that he was going to propose to me on our anniversary and was looking for a ring. It felt more like a divorce than a break up. Our relationship never had bad fights, we loved each other genuinely, and from almost every aspect, it wasn’t perfect but it was a great relationship. 

It’s been a couple of months since the break up and my coping skills have improved. I am still very hurt and very angry by what he did, but I now see that it had nothing to do with me. He was the one who ended the relationship in a nasty way and I did my best to try to fix it or at least save a friendship. He made sure to burn every bridge with me so eventually common sense kicked in and I started living my life for me. 

These recent months have been hard since I’ve had family members lose their jobs and some have been  hospitalized. But since I’m in a better mindset, I’ve been pushing through to be there for the people I love. 

A couple of days ago, I found out that my ex had tried to contact me through WhatsApp late in the night. I never use the app so I hadn’t blocked him from there nor did I realize he had even called me. A week after he tried to contact me again. He emailed me and sent me a chat through a video game we used to play together saying that he wanted to talk. I ignored them, but to be honest, it’s been in my mind. I talked to my family about it and was told he contacted them to try and get into contact with me. He asked them how I was doing, and to let me know that he was really sorry for what he did and how he did it because he knew how much it hurt me. 

Like I said before, my common sense finally kicked in and I am not ever going to go back to him and have sort of moved on. But I can’t help but want to get into contact to let out all my anger out on him and tell him to shove the apology to where the sun doesn’t shine. So ultimately, my question is how do I really move on? I still have all these feelings of being hurt and anger and I want to get rid of them and live happily with myself.

,dating_advice,"Hello reddit this is my first post so bear with me. I have been on this board for a few months now and have actually gotten some good info I just need a little advice. 

A little back story I am M29 with very little dating experience. I have had only one real relationship in my life that lasted 6 months and at this point it has been quite a few years since then. I am not unattractive I am just shy and have a hard time making friends. My lack of experience is entirely my fault as I have really not put any effort into dating. I spent the better part of my 20s on anti depression meds that killed my sex drive and I am now attempting to make changes. My social anxiety makes it hard for me to do things by myself and I tend to spend most of my free time at home when not doing things with friends. I am currently working on this and am going to try and get out of the house as much as possible. 

Over the past 6 months I have been slowly trying to gain some experience and am definitely learning a lot. Unfortunately since it has been so long I struggle to not come across as desperate and tend to over analyze everything. I am way too in my head. I am getting better over time but I wish we could just turn off our brains at times lol.

There is a girl I work with that I would like to get to know better. We work in separate departments and do not work directly with each other. I have known her for about a year and she is best friends with some of my other co workers. I am able to talk with her in passing and she tends to laugh at my dumb jokes but she is also the kind of person who is nice to and friends with everyone. Because of my lack of experience I assume she is just being nice. We seem to have quite a bit in common and I find her very interesting.  A few weeks ago I asked her to hang out outside of work to go shooting something we both enjoy doing and she agreed to go right away suggesting the local  range has a date night on Friday's. I get her number and later that day let her know my number and basically say next time you have a free Friday let me know and we can go to the range. This is where I may have fucked up. I have made plans with other people only to get ghosted or to have them cancel last minute so I was attempting to leave it up to her. I also am trying my best to not come across as desperate or pushy. Any way long story short she never texted me back lol which is honestly what I expected all along. I moved on and just felt better for even asking.

Fast forward to this week we are chatting again in the hallway. She was very interested in what we where talking about and said man we are going to have a lot to talk about on our shooting date. Again using the word date which I don't believe she means it in that way. I made the joke we will certainly talk a lot over all the gun shots. She says o we will have to get drinks after then. I honestly just want to try and make a new friend so this is positive but now here I am trapped in my own head again over thinking everything. I have a feeling she may have been dropping a hint that I should set up a date to go but I think my fear of rejection is preventing me from actually asking to go on a specific day. 

I am currently thinking that I should take the initiative and ask for a specific day. But my other side is saying to just wait and see what happens. Should I attempt to make a specific date or should I leave it up to her to make plans?

,dating_advice,"My (28m) wife (23f) and I have been together for 5 years, 3 and a half of them married. Best five years of my life... Until this fall.
While in the process of getting a loan for a house, depression started eating her up. She found herself simply no longer happy where she was, despite all I was trying to do for her. I wanted to make it work, but she gave up. 
2 months ago she started talking to another man. One month ago she came forward about it, and since then she made her intentions to leave very clear. I was heartbroken. I did everything I could to alleviate stresses off her, be loving and gentle... She is my world. We had a lot of interventions where she quietly said she would try again with me... But ultimately kept going back to him. He was the only thing she felt happiness in.

Well, yesterday I came home to an empty house. She's three states away with another guy. She says we are over. I'm absolutely devastated. I take marriage commitment very seriously, and tried my hardest, but she stopped trying 2 months ago. Now I know it will take time to heal... But I need hope I'm not going to be alone. If I am going to move on and find somebody else, I know the process of building a new relationship is going to take a long time.

Legally, we are still married. Haven't even changed our Facebook status. And knowing her, she won't get around to filing divorce paperwork until her new bf makes her, which may take a while. But just like I said I take marriage very seriously... Marriage isn't paperwork anyway. Marriage is a commitment. 

So, while I don't care about papers and last names that much... I don't want to be inappropriate about how I present myself out there on the dating market. How soon is too soon? For my wife, it was 2 months before we ended. Once I gather myself emotionally over the next week or two... When should I get a tinder or dating website profile set up? If at all? Again...

,dating_advice,"Edit: the word in the title should be “sported”, not “spotted”. 

So yesterday I posted about how I had a massive black eye from a Muay Thai sparring accident and a date with my crush scheduled for tonight asking for advice on the best way to deal with the situation. I got a lot of great advice, though some of it was contradictory but the overall tone of the responses I got was that I shouldn’t worry about showing up with a black eye and if she’s worth starting a relationship with she won’t care all that much about my currently rough appearance.

After posting that last night, I woke up this morning with my eye looking even worse than it had when I first posted with the swelling not improving and the bruising only getting darker, but I wasn’t phased, keeping a lot of the advice I had gotten in mind. I decided that I would let her know that I had a black eye, but also that I wasn’t going to apologize for it. I simply texted her saying: “ I can’t wait for tonight! Just wanted to let you know that I’m going to have a black eye for our date, but I’m looking forward to (partially) seeing you!”  She responded sympathetically, but said she was excited for it too. 

When it came time for our date, I drove over to her house and she saw me for the first time since I got the shiner.  Since it has only gotten worse since I took this [picture](https://imgur.com/a/16lm6hE), needless to say she was shocked. She initially was seriously concerned about it, but I did my best to downplay it and joked that she “should see the other guy because he looks much better than me” which might’ve been a corny joke, but it drew a laugh and eased some tension that really just seemed to arise from concern. After that I asked if she was ready to go, and she said she was and we went out to dinner. 

When we got to the restaurant and walked in, we  certainly got some stares which I’m sure were directed at her because she was looking so pretty and definitely not at the plum that had replaced my left eye. We sat down and we had an amazing dinner, filled with the actual story of how I got my black eye (with maybe a few embellishments), my background, her background, some funny stories from our time at school, and some occasional teasing from me when I caught her staring at my shiner. We basically ended up almost closing the place down (sorry waitstaff), but I paid and we decided to go for a walk around town before heading back. We continued our great conversation on our walk which continued the whole time I drove her home.

After getting back to her apartment, I walked her to her door and she thanked me for a great night. I thanked her for agreeing to come with me in spite of my grotesque appearance and asked if she wanted to do this again. She said she did and suggested next Friday so that “maybe [I’ll] be able to see by then!” which we both laughed at. We made eye contact and I leaned in for a kiss and she reciprocated. We kissed briefly and then she opened her door, before winking at me and saying “See ya, shiny,” before closing it and me wishing her a good night. 

I was so worried about this date, but it ended up being by far the best date of my life, black eye and all. Hopefully things continue to go well and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me and her!

Tl;dr: After getting a massive black eye shortly after asking my crush out on a date, I decided that there was no point in feeling embarrassed and sorry for my self and decided to keep the date and had the best date of my life, and have the chance to cultivate a great relationship with a girl I’ve had a crush on for a while. 

I’m so glad that I decided to swallow my pride and show up with the shiner instead of canceling. It’s easy to give up when you face a little adversity, but if you can overcome it, that adversity may become a strength like it did for me.  I guess I would also say that this experience has showed me that it’s also important to give people more credit and that what will happen is almost certainly going to be much better than the worst case scenario in your head.

,dating_advice,"So back in August, my ex of 7 months and I broke up, for reasons that there was no spark, he was not at all falling in love with me, and the occasional arguing. On Nov. 22, we matched on Hinge, I remember ""swiping right"" on him on there just to see if he would do the same, and alas, he did, we texted on there and on imessage for 2-3 days but with busy lives (and he seems to be uninterested?), we stopped talking for 4 days, then I messaged him on a Saturday, thinking hey I got nothing to lose when he does not respond. He responded a few mins. after, we talked and stuff, then he asked me to hang out. So the next night, we went to watch a movie and went back to his place to have sex. We did talk about how I don't want anything casual (he was not against casual dating), We agreed on dating but taking everything slow and to not repeat whatever happened during our relationships. Then he would text me good morning for 2 days, then just stopped, I did not want to be annoying so I stopped texting him as well. I don't want to be the one to make stuff happen. But I do know how busy are lives are, so I could not tell if we're just busy or we're not that interested in making this work. He is working 2 jobs, a full time one and part time at night. I am also working part time and going to school full time. I also work on weekends when I have the extra time. 

I'm not gonna lie, i was madly in love with him back when we we're together, I know there's still some feelings there for sure, there's a part of me that maybe if we're not too busy, this could work out, and there's a part of me that thinks I deserve better. 

Please help me, I don't know if its a good idea, but should I ask him if he is still interested or this is all over again? (I know it might hurt but wth, I got nothing to lose). Or should I just leave him alone? 

I did ask him if he is no longer interested that he should just straight up tell me cause this girl could not take hints. Yes, i suck at those. If you guys got any tips on this one, it would be much appreciated. 

I am writing it here because it is bugging me and I think my feelings might take over me thinking what's the right thing to do, and someone else's opinion would really be nice. Maybe see what's happening in a different set of eyes.

On Nov. 22, we matched on Hinge, I remember &amp;quot;swiping right&amp;quot; on him on there just to see if he would do the same, and alas, he did, we texted on there and on imessage for 2-3 days but with busy lives (and he seems to be uninterested?), we stopped talking for 4 days, then I messaged him on a Saturday, thinking hey I got nothing to lose when he does not respond. He responded a few mins. after, we talked and stuff, then he asked me to hang out. So the next night, we went to watch a movie and went back to his place to have sex. We did talk about how I don&amp;#39;t want anything casual (he was not against casual dating), We agreed on dating but taking everything slow and to not repeat whatever happened during our relationships. Then he would text me good morning for 2 days, then just stopped, I did not want to be annoying so I stopped texting him as well. I don&amp;#39;t want to be the one to make stuff happen. But I do know how busy are lives are, so I could not tell if we&amp;#39;re just busy or we&amp;#39;re not that interested in making this work. He is working 2 jobs, a full time one and part time at night. I am also working part time and going to school full time. I also work on weekends when I have the extra time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie, i was madly in love with him back when we we&amp;#39;re together, I know there&amp;#39;s still some feelings there for sure, there&amp;#39;s a part of me that maybe if we&amp;#39;re not too busy, this could work out, and there&amp;#39;s a part of me that thinks I deserve better. &lt;/p&gt;

Early on she told me she never seriously dated maybe a date here and there but it never lead anywhere. Anyway the most we’ve done is hold hands because I can tell she’s a little awkward with touch. 

On our last date we went out to eat and I suggested we watch some movies she recommended to me at her place. She was cool with it in text before the date. Then once we finished eating and we were walking back to our cars I mentioned want to go watch a movie you recommended?

And she’s never cancelled on a date like this before. To which I was a bit annoyed with mixed emotions. You can see my response in the photo to which I am thinking about leaving the ball in her court to contact me.

I have a crush on a girl who I used cuddle with(no not friendly cuddles) , watch series and stuff, joke a lot.

What happened yesterday:-

So I’ve confessed to her and she said she likes me too, and I told her since we like each other a long distance relationship is worth a shot, she said that what if I see someone else, (I am really not that kind of a person).
Anyways so I told her that I won’t let her down on my side and that we should try it, but she had a past experience of a long distance relationship and didn’t end well, the rest was really emotional as I felt really down.

She tried to comfort me and she hugged me while putting my face on her chest, she told me that she hates goodbyes for this reason, I couldn’t do it anymore so we decided to end the day here, she gave me a long good kiss before I went home.

What should I do?:-
So ofc I still feel devastated, she told me before to go with her to Spain for a couple of days and to stay with her in the same place, it’s after one month and I am pretty attached, so do you guys think I should go and try to convince her again?

I've been head over heels for my crush that I met within a new friend group (24-30Ms) about 5 months back. I've gotten really good at reeling back feelings with new people I meet since a heartbreak a year ago. But I really fell for this new crush hard and fast. 
He and I have a lot of similar interests and come from very similar backgrounds and really speaks to a lot of my core desires. I felt like I started to like him for all the right reasons and I want to constantly talk to him because he's so interesting to me.
In the beginning, we hung out and chatted as a small group (24M/27M/27M and me 27F) deep into the night, opening up about past relationships and about life. I saw the group about once a week for about two months.  This went on a few more times before I started feeling like he, as well as maybe the group, started to pull back a bit. Then we saw each other maybe every other week for the last few months. 
I contemplated to be honest about my feelings in the beginning, but had feared that I could lose this friend group all together if it wasn't reciprocated.
Fast forward to about a month ago, my crush has not responded to the last two messages I sent him and overall wouldn't give much response to my comments on our group chat. I thought maybe he's just a bad texter, but from what I gathered with another good friend of mine in the group (27M, the two are pretty close friends) my crush constantly reaches out to my friend to chat, hang out, whatever. And my crush would initiate conversations more than the friend for him. So it's not like he ignores his phone, but it's because he chooses not to talk to me.
So I decided that my crush definitely does not like me back and that I should try to move on and try to hang out with the group with or without him. I haven't seen him in a while due to holidays and being out of town for different people in the group. I've been trying my best to ignore him and ignore all the desires to talk to him. But every time he's shows up either in my friends' story or when he post stories I can't shake that joy of seeing his face and seeing him smile. I feel like there's a little part of me that just glows. He's not the hottest guy in the room, but something about his essence that I just absolutely adore and I can't help but smile to myself. I've been pretty good with out of sight, out of mind. But, I know the moment I see him again in person, I'll probably get the rush all over again.

And I want it to stop because I can't have him. So please, help me.

TL;DR- Met crush through a new friend group. Fell for him hard because we come from similar backgrounds and have similar interests. Crush doesn't like me back. I need to find a way to move on. Tips?

P.S. maybe the truth is that I don't want to move on because I've never quite met someone like him. But I can't change the ways a heart for him.

,dating_advice,"I'm on mobile so sorry about the formatting. Hey ladies, a few months ago my fiance came out and admitted to cheating. I was devastated but knew that I had to move on, we we're together for two years and was my first true love. I've recently gotten over her and I am ready to get back into the dating scene. Here's some issues or concerns that I've noticed. 

1) I'm introverted, not in the sense that I can't talk to people, I'm in nursing school, I have to talk but in that I don't like the bar scene or having to go out to large events. I can handle it every now and again but again not my thing. 

2) I will not date someone I work with, I worked with her for 1.5 years and have decided that is a bad idea. 

3) I don't really have trouble talking to anyone it's the whole entire walking up and introducing myself. I don't care for social media and that seems to be a major thing that my age group revolves around.

,dating_advice,"Hey Reddit,

How is everybody doing today?

TL;DR - I [20m] talking to [18F] First week was 100mph, Agreed things were going too fast, just need some advice on how I handled the situation and decided to step back and give her some space

Here’s my story, would like some advice from you guys on how I handled the situation and what I can do going forwards.

I [20m] talking to a [18F]

FYI - I have never had a girlfriend, or anything close to a relationship, but I’m a confident social person.


So I matched with a girl on tinder 2 weeks ago and we hit it off straight away, we had a similar sense of humour, lived near by, she’s very pretty and seems like a really cool girl. So I asked her on a date, and accepted! Fantastic!! (Date was on the Saturday) 

We chatted some more and ended up meeting twice before our planned date (this is all in week 1 btw) the first time we met (Tuesday) we walked half way to meet each other. We went for a drink before walking around and talking, we walk talked about everything and held hands, talked about what we wanted going forward, a bit about our past. It was really cute, and we ended up having a kiss at the end of our first date, in her words it give her “fanny flutters” lol made me very happy!

Things continued progressing and talked and decided that the Saturday was still quite far away, so we decided to meet up again on the Thursday, this time she came round to mine and we had a wonderful evening, we had sex, watched a movie, talked some more. I dropped her home and she said that she’d had a wonderful night and that we were both looking forward to the Saturday. I slept like the happiest kid in the world Thursday night. 

Saturday rolls around, and I had booked tickets for a Christmas market and then we were going to go for dinner afterwards. Originally I had planned to pick her up at 4pm. However, as we were both in town running some errands we decided to meet up before, I bought her a coffee and we went to sort her mobile phone out with the plan of heading to the Christmas market afterwards. Sorting her mobile out took longer than expected (even the possibility of a parking ticket, which she said she would pay half if I did get one) and by the time we got to the Christmas market it was late, (the entrance was difficult to find and it was dark anyway) so we decided to drop my car off at my house and then walk to the local pub for some food and drinks, she was going to come and stay round mine after. Again we had a great evening of chatting and drinking, however the date had to be cut short as she had some personal issues to sort out (aka period) , I could tell she felt guilty for leaving early, but I reassured her that it was fine and I could see her another time, she got a taxi home and I went home too.

On the Sunday, I could tell something wasn’t quite right, and I messaged her saying that I appreciated her company and that she shouldn’t feel guilty at all as I still had a great time and I hoped she did too. The replies form her became a lot slower than before and in my mind I began to panic. I let her know that because we’d had such a fast week, of meeting 3 times in the first week of talking. I asked her and told her that I’d rather take it slow before I push her away. She replied and told me that it was nothing to do with me and that she just wanted to slow things right down and that she’d hopefully see me soon, I said to her thanks and we sorta continued chatting.

Over the next couple of days I became stressed as fuck about the whole thing thinking that I had done something wrong (I hadn’t as she had said) but I still couple help thinking that I did. So to help myself and give myself any hope of seeing this girl again, sent her a message, saying I was appreciative of where she is and that she needs time to think, I told her that it’s clear I like her but I don’t want to push her away. I continued that I was going to take a step back and give her some space and that she could message me when she’s ready. She was sorry but thankful that I was understanding and said that she hopes we speak soon. We spoke for a little bit more as I showed her my outfit for my Christmas party and I did actually get a parking ticket. She agreed to pay me - which she didn’t have to at all and I think that says a lot about her as a person. This morning I wished her a great weekend and that we will speak soon.

That’s the last contact I had with her today, giving her some space is what I need to do and that if/when she is ready, she will message me. I hope that she does as I quite like her and would want to continue to get to know her. But I understand that she’s in a difficult place and therefore I can’t push her away. I think she will appreciate the space and I think she will message me eventually but until then there is nothing I can do.

So my questions are... how well did I handle this situation? Even if nothing comes out of it, did I do the right thing? Or is there something I can do better for next time?

,dating_advice,"So for some reason, I've been on like 8 dates these past couple months and in almost all of them, the conversation would turn to ""So what were your previous relationships like?"" and ""Why did you end your last relationship?"" - never prompted by me - and I feel so conflicted about how to answer this. I was in 2 physically abusive relationships in a row, one which was really, really bad. Obviously, not good experiences and they hurt my self-esteem badly. I developed anxiety and depression because of these and went to therapy for a long time to sort it out. It's a big part of my life, and I feel like I can't really lie about these things.

So when they ask me, I just say, they weren't very good or it wasn't a good experience, in the vaguest way possible without going into details, but then they get curious and ask, ""What exactly happened?"" On 3 dates, I told them the truth ""He was abusive and it really sucked"" to which they told me stuff like, oh you deserve better, that's shitty of them. The other 5, I just said ""It didn't work out which is why I'm here!"" 

I always doubt which way to answer... if I tell the truth too early, it's like TMI and a little scary to hear, I think. If things go well and I tell them later, I feel like I was hiding something. I also don't want to lie outright and say ""My relationships were great! We just broke up because of timing/distance/etc."" 

So what is ""right"" here? I should mention I never ended up dating any of these guys for longer than 2 dates, which I have no idea if it has to do with this particular issue or not. But maybe.

A guy I met last month (26) and me (23) were texting back and forth a lot and asked if I had a boyfriend and I said I didn’t and he isn’t dating either.

Recently...he hasn’t texted me. The last text I got was his was Monday. I sent him a message on Facebook (since he added me) and he sees the messages I sent to him but never replies.

He does have BPD so could this be an issue contributing to him not messaging me back?

Help would be appreciated :)

PS: He also did flirt with me too saying stuff like good morning beautiful or good night and sweet dreams etc

,dating_advice,"I could really do with some objective assessment of my situation because I am confused.

I’m in my late 20s and he is in his early 30s. We met at a mutual client meeting for a project in November last year. We don’t work for the same companies but our respective employers had a mutual contractor. 

There was nothing about our conversation during the meeting that was personal. He found me on facebook that night and messaged me saying thanks for all my help during the meeting and generically asking about my day. 

We messaged back and forth over a few days. I noticed it often took a couple of hours for him to reply, which was longer than I was used to, but each reply was substantial. It was full on, telling me about himself, his family, his thoughts on things and asking a lot of questions about me. 

Then he suddenly disappeared off the radar and I remember feeling a little bit led on and disappointed. As silly as it sounds in my late 20s, I appreciated those heartfelt messages although they were infrequent. I had already developed a little crush on him.

During this awkward time of silence is when I discovered we had mutual friends from the same grad school. Some of them were telling me that he was asking around about me. They said it wasn’t like him to take an interest in someone and show it as he was the most reserved person.

A couple of months later, the cycle restarts after we cross paths again at the project meeting. This time, I was more or less indifferent about his messages and I noticed that sometimes it would take a couple of days before he replies. But again, when he replies, it would be quite “substantial” and personal. 

At this point in time, I was annoyed at not knowing how I felt about this and I decided I didn’t like it. So I just asked him to grab lunch so I could see what he’s like in person. 

Lunch was surprisingly pleasant and I walked away feeling good about having found a friend. He was exactly the same in person, asking lots of questions about me appearing to be genuinely interested in the person that I am. But he never came across as flirty. 

This cycle of sporadic messaging, grabbing lunch, being ghosted then awkwardly saying hello at the next client meeting repeated about two or three more times over 12 months. 

Fast forward to November this year, I was content with having a friend that was him. I was now used to his “pace”.

Then he got a new job, became even busier and as much as he tried, it was impossible to catch up with him in person. 

He would suggest lunch then cancel on the day because he had to go to work. He suggests another date which doesn’t work for me. I suggest an alternate date including on the weekends, which he agrees to, then cancels again either the day before or on the day. Always for work. 

After about a week of rescheduling, I got fed up. We both work in a demanding industry and I appreciate that climbing up the corporate ladder is very much his agenda. As much as he’d like to keep me as a friend, he simply could not prioritise me over work. I felt that I was not even asking for much time.

I replied back saying I appreciated that he wanted to see me but quite frankly it wasn’t going to happen because of his work commitments. Then he miraculously came up with a date which he promised would not be interfered with. 

So we finally grabbed our third or fourth lunch. He explained in great detail as to why he’s so busy. I felt bad because he seemed insanely busy. It was his dream job and admittedly his employer boasts of a great reputation in the industry. So I shouted him lunch and wished him well for his new project and happy holidays etc. I again walked away feeling content about what a cool friend I was. Again, I didn’t feel like we were on a date. 

Then he showed up at our old mutual client’s end of year function. We talked for a little bit and I moved on to other people. He took a seat at one of the tables and stuck to it. 

At one point in time, our mutual friends from grad school got drunk and pulled both of us in and tried to get us to hug. They were saying they know we both like each other, etc. Felt a little bit like high school again but I hated that I didn’t mind that. My friend was too polite to just grab me for a hug in front of a drunken crowd. He stood there blushing and smiling. I didn’t think much more of it. 

But later that night, he messaged me saying he liked me. 

I was shocked because I was convinced that he saw me as a friend all this time. According to what I know, he would have made more of an effort to message back in a more timely fashion and meet up with me for a quick coffee or something like that if he took an interest in me in that way. But he didn’t.

I couldn’t tell him I liked him back because I don’t. At least not yet anyway. Over the last year, I had been so busy trying to read him, I didn’t think about how I felt, not about the situation but about him. 

I suggested we talk over coffee, he agrees, we set up a date on a weekend. Then he cancels. Work again. 

I would have thought, at this crucial point in time, he would have made some extra effort to make sure we talk. But no. He hasn’t even replied to my message yet since apologising to me and cancelling on me.

,dating_advice,"Hey y’all!

So, I wanna preface this by saying that I (19F) am a hopeless romantic and that I also tend to overthink absolutely everything. 

I’ve only been in one relationship. It ended with me getting hurt unintentionally. He told me that he never felt this way about anyone and that I was an amazing girlfriend, but he was too busy and never saw himself getting married so he didn’t see the point in dating. 

Well, it’s been quite some time since the breakup. I’ve gone on dates and almost gotten into relationships, but never found someone that I could see myself dating. Until now. 

He’s so amazingly sweet. We had our first date after talking for 2-3 weeks and he paid for everything, which is something that I’ve never had happen. I always insist on splitting the check or I pay. But he wouldn’t let me. Our second date was two weeks after that, with us talking every day since we had begun talking in the first place. He paid for everything again. 

After that, he told me (completely out of the blue) that he really liked me a lot. I told him that I did too. We talked a bit and he said that I deserved to hear that every day. It made me more happy than I’ve felt in a long time. He then asked me to go to dinner later that week. The day comes and he cancels, but apologizes profusely. He had work and a project and just didn’t have time. 

We haven’t seen each other in over two weeks, but talk pretty much every day. However, the conversation has slowed a bit. He told me that he’s extremely busy, which I totally understand and believe. And when I asked him to go out again, he said that he would not be free until like a week and a half from now. 

In total, we have been talking for two months but only seen each other twice, with two dates being cancelled due to conflicting schedules. 

I like him a lot and feel like I could definitely see myself dating him exclusively in the near future. But, I’m worried that he maybe is too busy for me. 

We met on a dating app and his profile said that he’s looking for a relationship, but I feel guilty if he’s busy and if seeing me is going to cause him stress over how busy he is. 

I’m stuck because I like him more than I liked my ex, but it’s stressing me out not getting to see him more often. My ex and I would see each other 3-4 times a week, but did not talk outside of that.

,dating_advice,"Hi Reddit,

I’ve never been into the college hookup scene. A boyfriend broke up with me over the summer and I was really heartbroken but starting to heal over it — mostly by believing that even though he had many good qualities, he had a few really bad qualities that I could never want in a partner.

After this breakup, I started to want to actively meet new people. I downloaded Tinder, really nervous, half hoping people would swipe and half hoping they wouldn’t.

The first guy who chatted with me was older — a med student — and we met up, watched a movie and made out a bit. It was fun, and although I’m not screaming to see him again, I’d be happy going on another date with him.

The second guy just left my apartment, and for some reason I kind of feel like I want to cry. Please help.

This guy is 6 years older than me, also a student. He’s really into rough Dom/sub dynamics, which I love. But he was very clear about what he wanted:

- he says it’s too soon from a breakup for him to jump into another relationship
- he doesn’t do exclusivity until it’s “been earned”
- he has rules about bodily upkeep and sex

The last thing is acceptable in a kink context I think, but his particular rules are not my favourite rules (TMI warning: anal, shaving). That’s minor though, compared to the casual &amp; nonexclusive points, which are bigger problems for me.

I thought my last boyfriend had commitment issues and past trauma. Wow. This guy is a new level.

I’m dealing with really complicated feelings now.

1) I think I’m suddenly really sad about losing my ex. I thought he was flaky and unreliable and emotionally unavailable and uncommitted. But he didn’t mean to be any of those things, I think. He didn’t want to be, and he wanted to fix things. Whereas my Tinder date just owns his assholery. At least he’s clear about what he wants, which might save some heartache? But my ex suddenly doesn’t seem that bad in comparison.

2) I don’t know if/how I want to continue this Tinder date.

I’m really close with my mother and usually tell her all about my relationships, but this is one I can never imagine telling her about — she’d be so disappointed. I might also not be sexually compatible with this date — e.g. (TMI sorry) sure, I like wild anal when reading bdsm fiction online, but I don’t know if I like it irl.

The bigger question is exclusivity and casual dating. I obviously opened myself to this possibility by going on Tinder, and I liked it with the med student even though there was no promise of serious exclusivity there either. So why does not being exclusive and serious with this guy bother me? Is this a sign I should stop the relationship before it does emotional damage to me?

Honestly, I don’t think he would be a good match for me (or uh, anyone — unless they are as damaged as him, maybe) for a long term, serious relationship. But the nonexclusivity and casualness make me uncomfortable. I’m so confused.

I love his personality, our banter is entertaining, he’s sexy as hell, gentlemanly, and he knows how to make me feel good.

How should I think about whether to continue this date?

,dating_advice,"Okay some backstory, I was talking to this guy about two years ago and we had great conversation over text and we were always trying to meet up but our schedules kept clashing so eventually we stopped talking.

This year I saw him again on dating apps and we started talking again. We had great conversations over text, he was responsive, witty and funny. he would text me in the morning and ask how my morning was going. So we finally decided to meet up and i initially just wanted to hang and play videogames but we had amazing conversation and I felt we had incredible chemistry. He ended up asking to stay the night and we cuddled and made out and he went to work the next morning. He seemed interested in me too and we made plans to see a movie the day after but I noticed that he’s been a lot less responsive to my text messages and doesnt take the initiative to text.

It’s been hard to call him as well because he usually doesn’t pick up even though he’s told me he prefers speaking over the phone to texting. I had dinner with him two days ago and made clear my intentions that I really like him and I’m interested to date and he told me he’s still dealing with the hurt of rushing into his last relationship and wants to take things slow.

And I totally get that and want to respect his space and time that he needs. But he told me he’s NOT emotionally unavailable he just doesnt want to rush things.

I told him I’m honestly not interested in talking to other guys right now cause I really want to work things out with him and he said to not delete the apps I’m using and not invest in him too much. 😩

Our date went really well overall and he was affectionate and I kissed him goodbye as he was leaving and he sent me a text after saying he had a nice time and he put the gift I got him on his keys.

We made plans to meet up next week before I leave for a family trip for a month and I really want to see him before I go.

I’ve also been trying to hold off on texting him too much since maybe one or two a day just stuff like ‘have a good day at work’. But he’s not been responding or doesn’t text me. It’s just been really confusing for me because in person, everything feels right but when we aren’t physically there I just feel a lack of communication. I know hes busy and works two jobs but it’s really rough when you like someone and they say they’re attracted to you but it doesn’t feel that way with their actions I guess.

I also want to take things slow but how are we going to get to know each other better or progress if there’s a lack of communication? I’m wondering if I should give him more time and space or if he’s just not emotionally invested in dating me.

,dating_advice,"I’ve been working days at lot at my job, which means I’m usually there when our delivery guy (Brandon) drops off our stock. I was chatting with him one day, and after he left, one of my coworkers informed me I was flirting with him, and he was flirting back.

Some backstory: I’m a 24 year old female who has never been in any relationship, and has never really felt interested in dating or being with anyone. I think it’s having really low self-esteem and thinking no one would ever be interested. Like I had my friends and family growing up (most of which are female). And I am completely clueless when it comes to the romantic side of things. I thought I was being nice, until my coworker told me it was flirting.

So anyways, the next time he came in, we were talking again. But it felt a little different this time, because I knew I was interested, and I think he was too. He said things like “I’d stay here all day if I could,” and helped me sort some stuff (which he doesn’t normally do) so he could stay a little longer. I was on the cash at one point, and he leaned in close to get the permanent marker resting on top of my keyboard.

Again, I know nothing of romance. But if he asked me out, I wouldn’t say no. The flirting is fun and it seems like we have a lot in common.

I was chatting with him one day, and after he left, one of my coworkers informed me I was flirting with him, and he was flirting back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some backstory: I’m a 24 year old female who has never been in any relationship, and has never really felt interested in dating or being with anyone. I think it’s having really low self-esteem and thinking no one would ever be interested. Like I had my friends and family growing up (most of which are female). And I am completely clueless when it comes to the romantic side of things. I thought I was being nice, until my coworker told me it was flirting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyways, the next time he came in, we were talking again. But it felt a little different this time, because I knew I was interested, and I think he was too. He said things like “I’d stay here all day if I could,” and helped me sort some stuff (which he doesn’t normally do) so he could stay a little longer. I was on the cash at one point, and he leaned in close to get the permanent marker resting on top of my keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I know nothing of romance. But if he asked me out, I wouldn’t say no. The flirting is fun and it seems like we have a lot in common. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m posting this here to see what you guys think: do you think he’s interested? Should I ask him out? Am I being completely delusional?&lt;/p&gt;

I am 32(m), the first time I asked her out I became just like David Deida says in the quote below, I became  hurt, withdrawed and closed in on myself, I stopped seeing friends, and other people. I had such high expectations of a life with this girl. I know now not to have any expectations of others. You can't change other people.

Here is the quote:

&gt; “How do you react with your body, breath, and eyes? Notice if you react to a person or situation that hurts you by withdrawing, hiding, or closing in on yourself. Notice if there are times when you find it difficult to look into someone’s eyes, or times your chest and solar plexus become tense and contracted. These are signs of an unskillful reaction to hurt.”

,dating_advice,"So, this is a very long and confusing situation and I’m desperate for any advice as to what to do here.

I met this guy, (I’m going to call him R for anonymity) in September, we went on a few dates before he sent me a really long text saying he wasn’t looking for anything serious but wanted to keep seeing me. It wasn’t ideal for me but I figured that we hadn’t really seen each other that much so that was ok, I wanted to see where it was going to go.

We kept seeing each other for the next couple of weeks but then suddenly out of nowhere I got a second text saying he wasn’t looking for anything more than a friendship. I was understandably quite upset, I liked this guy but at the end of the day he was a nice guy so I chose to keep him in my life.

Anyway, one thing led to another and since mid-October we’ve been having a FWB relationship. I was quite obviously very into him and I guess thinking about it I was more invested in him at the time than he was in me, but I carried on the relationship anyway. We also went away on holiday during this time, all the while my friends said he’d been stringing me along, which to be honest I don’t dispute.

For the last few weeks, however, I’ve kind of felt the intense feelings for R kind of wane, and I’ve been seeing someone else (going to call him G). I really like this guy and it’s early days, and I was fine about balancing R and G because I felt no obligation to either to be ‘faithful’ as it was early stages of dating/a FWB situation. 

So now here’s where the tricky bit comes in.

The other day I got a text from R saying that everything he’s ever said to me about never getting into a relationship with me wasn’t true, and that he just couldn’t let himself have feelings for me so I wouldn’t get hurt. Obviously I’ve been seeing G pretty much every day the last couple of weeks and I reckon that I like him just as much, if not more, than R. 

But ever since getting that text I’ve been really confused, I genuinely believe that I like both guys the same amount, even though I’m well aware that R’s been stringing me along for a while. I’ve had multiple conversations with R since getting that text and I believe he’s as sorry as he says he is for messing me around.

I’m also exploring the fact that I might be poly, and I’m scared that if I bring that to either of them I might lose one of them. I’m so confused about all of this and I don’t know what to say to either of them. I really want to take both seriously and don’t want to feel like I’m being selfish or deceitful/stringing anyone along because I know how that feels. 

I’d be really appreciative if I could get some outside perspective on the situation.",t2_4l785tox,False,,0,False,"Stuck between two people [22m, 21m] I’m [19f] in love with, any advice welcome please!",[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e7fs2m,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575762344.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this is a very long and confusing situation and I’m desperate for any advice as to what to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"sorry i know this is a lot, need to get this out

bit of background. in the start of 2018 I \[24M\] realized how antisocial i was and unfriendly towards people. Then i made more of an effort to connect with people and went to a party and met this girl who showed a bit of interest in me.

what ultimately happened was that as we chatted for a few months, i let romantic interest hijack my thoughts and put a lot of valence on something that wasnt there. i would compulsively check her socials for activity. but even when we were talking it was odd and difficult because i felt more alone then i was before and i was overthinking a lot. eventually as her interest waned, i got the sign and deleted her from socials, meditated, got a good job, continued to try to be a better person and got over it.

fast forward to september 1. im at my favourite dj show having a good time, and i got this girls number \[24F\] and we really hit it off that night. she lives kinda far from me and we texted daily for 3 weeks. it was too good to be true at this point, she was showing genuine interest in me and wanted to see me. we hung out on the 4th week and had an amazing, intimate weekend.

i tried to guard myself by rationalizing that she must do this with guys frequently, and i was no exception. but the following day she texted me and said she had a good time with me. we continue texting for 3 weeks and tried to meet up soon as we could since she was travelling to southeast asia but we were both busy. but the week before she left, she just ghosted me for 3 days untill double texted her and i asked her about hobby progress. she responded saying she “sucks at texting sometimes”, and continued the convo, where i responded “i thought you ghosted me lol” and i tried to continue the convo. and then she ghosted me for another 3 days till i asked if everything was ok, to which she responded that there was family stuff going on. and i acknowledged

a few days later, the night she was leaving for her trip, i was drunk and sent her a gushy ‘safe travels’ text putting her on a pedestal and saying i care about her, i think shes an amazing person and i couldnt forget about her. she thanked me and apologized about being a bit distant because of ‘life stuff’. 2 weeks later i wished her happy birthday and she thanked me

inbetween here she unliked one for the three tweets she liked of mine, yeah idk (it was the only like so it was obvious lol)

3 days ago, as i assumed she was back from her trip, i texted her asking how she is and got no response for about a day so i double texted her saying we should talk in a couple weeks after my final exams to sort things out

the story i tell myself is that she is going through a lot. i guess( based on what shes told me and her twitter activity) her real dad didnt want to be a part of her life, and therefore lacks the capacity to engage with me as she did before.

but damn i like her. everything seemed right and we have a lot of similarities. it felt like we had a really good connection. i wanna be there for her unconditionally but its been weighing me down a lot. i let my guard down because she showed genuine interest and talking to her/ hanging with her made me feel confident and like i could be more of myself.

am i romanticizing a platonic interest? it now feels the same way it did last year where im overthinking and assuming that shes the one, although there is way more reciprocation in this situation.

should i just accept the L? shes giving me mixed signals but she doesnt care enough to not ghost me, like what would i even say to her in a couple weeks when i declared we should talk? if i just dont get ghosted again. i want to delete her from socials start moving on but i also would like closure given theres stuff going on with her.

maybe i could be more patient but i also need to disentangle myself from being blindly hopeful things will work out with her. how do i be hopeful for the future and tell myself im gonna meet someone with a better spark/connection.

i know i should just be chill and accept that ppl go through things but its hard because that implies that im waiting/allowing her to come back if in my life.

So, we don't always get time to talk on phone. It'e me who calls her usually, but she also calls me. Like for instance, she sometimes wakes me up in the morning when I tell her to do so, and also she wished me before an examination couple of days back.

There's a girl I'm friends with, we're quite flirty and on a recent holiday we kissed a few times, but decided to leave it when we got home. It's complicated, but blah blah blah's aside there's still a lot of sexual tension.

So, I’ve been dwelling on posting this for a while, or even getting advice over it, but here goes. 

Just over a year ago, I met someone through work, let’s call her Abbie. Abbie and I hit it off pretty quickly and started to speak daily.  It was pretty clear we liked each other and I wanted to take things further, but there was one hitch, she had just broken up with a long term boyfriend, so quite rightly didn’t want to jump into anything. 

Fast forward a year and we’re currently still talking and I’m working elsewhere. I took time away from talking regularly  to try and get over it all. Don’t think it worked. During that time and currently still, I downloaded all of the popular dating apps, to see if it was just the attention that I was enjoying. I’ve been on a few dates, but never make it past the second as there always that what if in the back of my head of maybe it’ll happen eventually and I just don’t commit to more. I enjoy myself on the dates, so I don’t know why I can’t get myself to commit. Still, after a year, she still tells me it’s just a matter of time, but I don’t know if I’m being naive in believing that.

So, what I’m after is your guys’ opinion, do I wait it out or am I being naive.

I can’t tell if he thinks of me as a friend or something more.

One day I asked him if he wanted to go eat dinner together.

* He has texted me pictures of meals he’s cooked a few times

When we first started dating he made it a point to shower every night. He never wore deodorant or attempted to control the stench that came from his feet and shoes. Here we are almost three years later, and he refuses to take responsibility for his hygiene. I have purchased him deodorant, body wash, things for his shoes. 

He will literally go up to two weeks without showering or cleansing himself. I essentially have to start an argument in order for him to do so, even though I purchased him deodorant and whatever else he needs to maintain his hygiene.

I'm a very clean person and I cannot deal with this type of lack of hygiene. Also, he is an alcoholic, so his body odor is way more than the normal, BO.

What do I need to do to convey to him that this is going to end up being the end of our relationship? Simply because he cannot efficiently clean himself and put deodorant on. Am I really asking too much? He stinks on a daily basis.

Tl:dr at the bottom

Backstory: I (24m) have been friends with this girl (23f) let’s call her...  Lani
We’ve been friends for years now. Met at a party thru a friend &amp; just hit off instantly. 
She just broke up her with her bf at the time so I was able to get her number
We texted pretty consistently &amp; actually met her family the next weekend for Halloween. 
Took all of them trick or treating &amp; met her mom etc.
She was still in love with her ex even tho we’ve slept together.
She never told him &amp; got back with him. 
I moved for work. 
We cut all contact for years because I couldn’t stand just being her friend. 
She called me 1,500 miles away at 2 am &amp; just said “we broke up” 
I told her I can’t do this anymore. I told her I have to wake up in a couple hours.
Even now, I always want more than just friends.
After years of no contact, she called me out of the blue 3 years later, crying. 
I love her, care for her, so I obliged. 
We talked &amp; caught up &amp; had some circumstances arranged that I can’t say because it’s too specific. (Not sexual)
I went back home after not seeing her for a long time &amp; I just kinda...blew up. she missed me, I missed her
Made reservations to a 3 Michelin star restaurant, bought a lil semi formal suit &amp; copped a hotel for those arranged circumstances but... she stood me up.  She it’s wrong because she has a boyfriend. 
&amp; shes... right. 
She’s in a bad spot financially &amp; spiritually but doing better. 
I took advantage of her spilling her feelings &amp; personal problems about her &amp; her bf to heart by making reservations. 
I shouldn’t have done that. 
I don’t blame her at all. She has a bf. Even if they’re having some issues.

,dating_advice,"First of all, sorry if this doesn't exactly belong here.

I haven't had a lot of luck with dating in my life. I'm in my mid-20s and on the autism spectrum, and unfortunately I also have treatment-resistant anxiety and depression. I've had maybe three or four dates in my entire life and I've never gotten to a second date. It's crossed my mind that my mental health might be what's holding me back, but I want to rule out any other possibilities first, since there isn't much I can do for the mental health side of things that I'm not currently doing or have tried in the past\*. 

I haven't had a lot of time for my hobbies lately because I'm in a school that really doesn't have any social clubs or events, and an absolutely suffocating workload. Before that I was working full time for several months. Exams will be over soon and I thought I might get back into some hobbies that I haven't had time for in a while, like hiking and cliff climbing. I thought about maybe looking into local meetup groups for these, and I figured I might meet some people there that could possibly open doors both for making new friends and for dating. Since I also love birds and I'm planning on working at a bird rescue center, I thought I might also look for a place to volunteer with birds where I might meet like minded people. That being said it sort of crossed my mind that maybe these circles are too small and don't necessarily have a lot of people close to my age involved in them. I don't know if there are any other activities that are more likely to draw in people in their 20s. Should I broaden my horizons? 

I didn't have a lot of luck with dating apps, although I didn't use major ones like Tinder or Bumble. I also realize looking back that maybe some of my photos in my profile weren't the best. I did get one date of of OKcupid, which just kind of fizzled out since neither of us were really interested in the other (technically I got two, but I was catfished on the other one so I'm not counting it). Should I give dating apps another try with better pictures or more popular apps? 

One other thing that's crossed my mind is that maybe some of my unintentional body language might be off-putting. Like I said I'm on the autism spectrum (officially diagnosed with Asperger's). I've done a LOT of work to build on my social skills and understanding of other people's cues, but I sometimes wonder if my body language might still seem a little ""off"", and if it is, what I might be able to do about it. Is there even such a thing as body language coaching? 

So yeah, those are things that come to mind off the top of my head that I can change. You might have noticed that I haven't really talked about my mental health, and that's because I really have done just about everything I can for it already. I'm diagnosed with treatment-resistant anxiety disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Since I was six years old I've seen nine therapists, gone through more types of therapy and medication changes than I can remember, been given a ton of different supplements, and cut gluten, sugar and dairy out of my diet. None of it has done much to help. My current therapist has been quite honest that this may be something that I'll always live with in some capacity and that I might not be able to get rid of it, just manage it and hopefully reduce it. 

If this really is the only thing or the main thing that's holding me back, then I probably will just have to come to terms with not being cut out for dating or relationships, no matter how much I might want to be. I hope this isn't the case, but as I've gotten into my mid-20s with no success at dating I've had to consider that possibility more and more.

I [22M] work in this street food place owned by my dad and this girl [21F] has been coming every Sunday morning (the only day we open) to eat for the last 2 months but this past Sunday was a little different. I was working, this girl finished her food and was waiting for her brother and mother to finish theirs to leave, and my sister's bf asked me if I liked her, I thought he meant physically or just her face (lmao I'm so stupid) so I said yes, then he said I should buy her a orange juice from the guys next to us, I panicked and said no multiple times. They were the only customers at the moment so I went with my uncle and little cousin to them to talk, two minutes later I turn around and see the girl with a huge smile, it made me feel, comfortable and happy, I had never seen a smile bigger than that one, then I spotted THE ORANGE JUICE IN HER HAND, I felt like dying thb.
They left and I rushed there and asked to my sister's bf what happened, they gave her the orange juice saying it was from me, and she got happy and blushed! Thing I didn't noticed when I was a little far away. In Thursday, I was having breakfast with my sister and our older sister visited us, we were talking about what happened Sunday and turns out my mom knows this girl's mother AND THEY TALKED ABOUT IT TOO, her mother said to my mother how in their way back to home, the brother was chocking with his own saliva and she didn't want to share her juice because it was just for her, my mother said all this to my younger sister and that's how I know this, I rolled my eyes faking disinterest and went to brush my teeth, omw to the bathroom I heard they kept talking and I heard something that maybe I shouldn't have. Apparently, she has never had a boyfriend nor someone had gifted her something like ""I did"", besides her family of course, and it's kinda funny because I haven't had a girlfriend in my life either (I'm very stupid with girls, I've put myself in the friend zone multiple times). And it's weird because she's so pretty, a ten and I'm 7, a 4 next to her. Maybe that could be the reason why she hasn't had a bf, maybe everyone is too scared to ask her out, just like me.

Idk what to do this next Sunday, I assume I'll see her that day, I've been literally thinking about her all day, every day and it makes me nervous. I guess I have to act like I really gave her that juice and pretend I don't know her name, which I know thanks to my mother. I thought about not charging what she eat this weekend, and asking her number, but I don't know if that will make her feel pressured and that's the last thing I want. I don't know if I should ask her first for her Facebook but it's been years since the last time I used mine. And in case she accepts, The place of the date should be totally her decision or should I propose something?

,dating_advice,I am a high school er Junior male who is really clingy and i need help? So to begin my story i asked a second exchange student out she was Finnish and she was in my marine bio class i never talked to her before but before we had a group project i decided to introduce myself on Instagram and i said i was interested in to getting to know her/country better and she said i could stop by in class so i came by and may of came off too strong and said im going to join your group she said ok. In class since the 1st exchange student was not there tht i asked out I thought it would be a good opportunity to start here so luckily for the lab we had to do alot of waiting so i got to talk to her alot im not great at small talk but i made her laugh or I think i did she could of been uncomfortable. The next day i made a mistake and asked her out via instagram got rejected made things uncomfortable the next day from her body language she was very.

,dating_advice,"I’m a nursing student. (29F)
I started dating one of the nurses(47M)on the floor I was precepting on. Things have been constant and steady for around 8 weeks or so. I met his 2 children, his parents and we had become intimate. 

2 weeks ago he hit me with “we need to talk” and he ultimately ended things. I was taken back, stunned and really hurt because I was starting to fall for him and I genuinely felt at home and safe with him. He said he just wants to be friends, but I’m not having that. I told him that I’ll be kind and civil to him if I ever see him, but unfortunately I cannot be just a friend with him when I had given myself physically and emotionally. He understood. We texted for a few days after and I just couldn’t handle the hurt and decided to block his Instagram, FB and delete his number.

So let’s catchup and bring you to this week. Specifically this past Tuesday. I took a picture of a gorgeous sunset and texted it to him, knowing he would love it. Sure enough, he responded instantly over the moon about the photo. He texted me all evening. The next day I wake up to a good morning text... wasn’t expecting that. Anywho, he goes on to say that he’s been thinking about me and that he was sorry for everything. We text all morning, afternoon and evening on Wednesday. He calls me and we’re on the phone for 30 minutes. Just small talk. Updating me on his kids, asking how my school is and when my graduation date is. 

I am thrown for a damn loop at this point because he has been actively flirting with me since Tuesday via text and phone calls. I hear from him this morning, wishes me good luck on my exam and calls me too. The last I heard from him today was around 435pm. I haven’t heard a peep and I had sent him several messages and haven’t gotten any response back. 30 minutes ago I reactive my Facebook and the first thing I do cause I’m nosey is being up male nurses’ page. My heart drops and I just start shaking. On Sunday he updated his profile photo to a picture of him and his ex. To make it even more interesting, Tuesday night(the day I reached out) he changed his profile photo to a picture that I had taken of trail I had been on that weekend and sent to him. He also changed his cover photo to another picture that I had taken and sent to him over a month ago.

I’m being played for a damn fool aren’t I? 
I haven’t heard one thing from him since this afternoon and all I can do is assume the worst. I noticed that when I have called him that his phone will sometimes ring once and then go to vmail. I didn’t think much of it until tonight and connected the dots that he has my number on DND if he’s with this woman. I’m just heartbroken and I just feel so used because I met his 2 kids, who absolutely LOVE ME and i adore them. I was also introduced to his mom and dad as well.

I (25F) have started talking with/casually dating a guy (26M) that I’ve known since middle school.

He was engaged to “the love of his life” just over a year ago and I’m super insecure about it.

,dating_advice,"Quick rundown: I’m an Asian girl who’s dated, and gone on dates, with people of different ethnicities (Mexican, white, Middle Eastern, etc.), but my honest-and-can’t-get-out-of-it preference is with Asian guys. My personal standard for them is fairly low—you don’t have to be very attractive or very tall or make a whole lot of money, but I rarely ever catch Asian guys’ interest. It’s honestly to do with familiarity: mannerisms, food, values, overall culture—still enough to learn from, but not uncomfortable. I’ve always liked that aspect with other Asians in general.

And I’ll be totally honest, I’m not that conventionally attractive. I’m a little boyish, but it never seems to be an issue with anyone but Asians (at least based on how much reciprocated interest I receive). I’ve been able to go on fairly recent dates with four Asian guys, and dated one longterm years ago, but it either doesn’t work out on my end or theirs. My biggest struggle is capturing any initial interest (then after, the genuine assessment of compatibility comes into play). I’m guessing it’s to do with not being very feminine and just having more atypical Filipino features (one of the East Asians I went on a date with said I had a very particular look, but I couldn’t gauge if that was good or bad).

To be clear, I’m not opposed to other races. The issue is that I tend to not find myself being attracted to anyone I see through dating apps (95% of my dating efforts) unless they’re Asian.

,dating_advice,"I think I should start by saying I've never been very good at the beginning of the dating process, at time I'm terrible at reading intentions with new people but have had a few serious relationships. Additionally I apologize fo the length but hope some one may be able to help.

I (22M) met a girl (21) in a shared class at college.  A few weeks she sat by me in lecture and started up a conversation. At the time I thought nothing of it but a few days later at an event for that class I caught her looking my way and she smiled before quickly turning away, later at the lunch for the event she sat at the same table as I did and started up a one on ok me conversation without the rest of the table. Since then she continued to sit by me in lecture and we started talking and walking after class every day. She seems to be more on the quite side, a little shy, but she's very sweet. After getting to know her I started getting interested in her, I asked if she'd like to go out some time and she said yes and gave me her number. Later when trying to set plans she apologised and said she had a lot of commitments at the time but would be free saturday after Thanksgiving giving which was a week away at the time. 

That weekend I texted her but never heard back, however on monday as always she sat with me and  started by asking if I had tried texting her and apologized for being terrible at it, I told her not to sweat it, from there we talked as normal, the day before Thanksgiving we texted for a while. On monday when we talked I asked if we were still on for Saturday and she apologised and said she hadn't realized how late Thanksgiving was and had a commitments sneak up she had to prep for and would have to let me know. I told her no problem and waited for her to say if she was good or not with the plan to ask on Friday, today, if she didnt. Today she left lecture early for the concert but looked at me and smiled and waved by before standing up to go.

Additionally I apologize fo the length but hope some one may be able to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (22M) met a girl (21) in a shared class at college.  A few weeks she sat by me in lecture and started up a conversation. At the time I thought nothing of it but a few days later at an event for that class I caught her looking my way and she smiled before quickly turning away, later at the lunch for the event she sat at the same table as I did and started up a one on ok me conversation without the rest of the table. Since then she continued to sit by me in lecture and we started talking and walking after class every day. She seems to be more on the quite side, a little shy, but she&amp;#39;s very sweet. After getting to know her I started getting interested in her, I asked if she&amp;#39;d like to go out some time and she said yes and gave me her number. Later when trying to set plans she apologised and said she had a lot of commitments at the time but would be free saturday after Thanksgiving giving which was a week away at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That weekend I texted her but never heard back, however on monday as always she sat with me and  started by asking if I had tried texting her and apologized for being terrible at it, I told her not to sweat it, from there we talked as normal, the day before Thanksgiving we texted for a while. On monday when we talked I asked if we were still on for Saturday and she apologised and said she hadn&amp;#39;t realized how late Thanksgiving was and had a commitments sneak up she had to prep for and would have to let me know. I told her no problem and waited for her to say if she was good or not with the plan to ask on Friday, today, if she didnt. Today she left lecture early for the concert but looked at me and smiled and waved by before standing up to go.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out she was on the same page in a lot of areas, were definitely a good match, she really likes and cares for me,  but the prospect of having a relationship and ruining the current vibe we have going on scared her, We get on really well and she doesn't want to ruin that which I fully understand. 

Also she mentioned about a lot going on in her personal life with work and school and extra pressure at the minute could be overwhelming, definitely understandable! 

She did say it wasn't a friend zoning situation and things won't get weird, but I told her if she ever wanted it to turn into something more i wouldn't ever rule it off the table, no pressure at all of course :) 

All this considered though I'm still a little confused on how to proceed or even feel about it

Naturally enough I ended up developing feelings for her and decided that tonight (as I&amp;#39;m the slow moving type lol) I&amp;#39;d tell her how I felt &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out she was on the same page in a lot of areas, were definitely a good match, she really likes and cares for me,  but the prospect of having a relationship and ruining the current vibe we have going on scared her, We get on really well and she doesn&amp;#39;t want to ruin that which I fully understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also she mentioned about a lot going on in her personal life with work and school and extra pressure at the minute could be overwhelming, definitely understandable! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did say it wasn&amp;#39;t a friend zoning situation and things won&amp;#39;t get weird, but I told her if she ever wanted it to turn into something more i wouldn&amp;#39;t ever rule it off the table, no pressure at all of course :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this considered though I&amp;#39;m still a little confused on how to proceed or even feel about it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just need to vent I think and any advice going forward would be greatly appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks lovelys x&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Hi, I'm pretty damn frustrated and confused about this whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started talking to this girl who goes to a college that's like 20 mins away like 2 weeks ago. As soon as we started talking, she went home for thanksgiving. As we started talking we hit it off very well, started flirting etc. She even tells me stuff like she doesn't like players so she wouldn't hang out with other guys etc....

She was supposed to come back on friday and she ended up setting her alarm too late so she could not come and hang out. Then we were supposed to hang out on saturday but she had to babysit her cousin all night so she couldn't hang out. On sunday, she got back but she was sick(?) and was throwing up so we didn't meet but she facetimed me. I mean she did look kinda sick so I don't think she was lying. She was flirting with me in the meantime so I was pretty confused. 

Then I planned AGAIN for this saturday since she had exams this friday and saturday. She did say she will be able to meet if  'as long as gets her studying done'. We facetimed today, but she pretty much told me she would study all day on saturday. I kinda got like turned off so I was kinda being straight forward and said if she actually doesn't wanna meet then that's cool. She tells me it's just cuz that she has finals going on and tells me she would tell me if she actually wasn't interested(?). Then tells me we can hang out over the break since she doesn't have much planned. 

Here is the thing though. She had a house party at her place on Wednesday night, and she went to the mall for tonight to get her friend a gift and drive her friends to the mall. I mean like tonight is the night before the exam and she tells me she can't hang out with me over the weekend since she has to study? It just makes me feel like she does not consider me seriously or idk what the hell is going on in her mind since she constantly flirts with me. 

Part of me kind of call her out and tell her that it doesn't make sense for me to keep waiting and try to hang out with her since she keeps flaking and I don't see a point of flirting if she doesn't seem like she actually wants to hang out with me. 

But also some part of me kinda wants to not cut her off cuz who knows what could happen? 

I mean she did stuff the day before her exam and the week of the exam so I am pretty annoyed that she canceled saturday.

I explain. I'm a total nerd (but i care for my image and consider myself slightly above avarage looking).I spend most of my time doin stuff in my house, playing music, videogames, working out, etc. I dont like to go out to crowded places, i prefer quiet and comfy.

I used to go out to parties w/friends but i had to stop drinking alcohol if i wanted to take care for my mental health, and since im taking meds cronically, now i get social anxiety going to parties or bars cuz im not drinking and i feel out of place so i stopped going out with my friends.

From 4 out of 5 of these guys, I've gotten compliments from them basically being like, I can't believe you're single for how pretty you are and I can't believe I'm talking to someone like you- which I know could be a ""line"" but I also do know that I am physically above-average attractive. Problem is I am insecure and anxious at times and have been in a few very abusive relationships. I don't know. I feel like because I have so many emotional insecurities, for how attractive I am on the outside, I probably seem really down-to-earth and ""normal."" I know this sounds very braggy and egotistical but I swear I'm not, I just want to paint a complete picture of what I look like and how my personality is.

On these dates, I feel like we talk about really deep things. Like one guy told me when he was 19, his girlfriend got an abortion and almost died. Another guy told me how he almost got married to his ex, but she cheated on him with 3 other men. I mean, we somehow always get into really deep shit and it's like this whirlwind of emotions and chemistry and attraction, and they're like, I don't want this night to end, holding onto me, kissing me, staying late. (No sex on the first dates though.) But I have never gotten a second date out of any of them, despite the fact that they were literally like, I don't want to go home, I want to keep being here with you. Like 3 of these guys have done that - saying, they don't want the night to end.

So what am I doing wrong? Why are they so into me the first day and then not? We do tend to drink on the first dates... is it just drunken lust? Do I need to stop doing drinks? I've always tried to filter my dates so they are not in it for hookups, so I know both our expectations are for relationships... but are they still just hoping for some action and when they don't get it, they just don't care anymore?

And I do disclose to them that I am anxious sometimes because I feel like it's just being honest. This tends to break the ice because most of them are like, yeah I'm nervous too! Or tell me something vulnerable. But is that vulnerability freaking them out the next day?

Seriously, I want to know why I'm failing so hard... can anyone advise?

Now I am notoriously late for everything, so I text him ""perfect cause I'm not ready yet. lmk when you're on your way."" so since I don't have to rush my make-up, I'm taking my time and listening to a podcast loudly. a few minutes before 7, I'm half dressed looking like I painted tribal marks on my face when I hear the doorbell ring then my dog starts whining at the door.

I'm disappointed at how he turned out to be but I'm more angry cause there was a kickback I declined to go to because of this date. Why would he not just say something came up? Cause I could've just gone and hung out with my friends. At the same time, maybe I'm being delusional but could that have been him at the door?

,dating_advice,"So - I’m referring to this girl as an ex because, we dated for a few months and that kind of constitutes an ex in my eyes. 

Basically, I lost my temper (verbally, not physically - it was over text). She had rung me at 1am the night before while on cocaine, because she was horny. I hadn’t answered but had gotten a serious fright because, my dad had a severe heart attack that day the year before and a call at 1am made me think he was sick again. I was also in the middle of stressful exams (final year of uni). 

She was complaining repeatedly about issues she was having with her college and I eventually lost it and told her, I wished she’d ‘aim this anger’ at somebody who could actually change things in her college and ‘not just some white girl’ (meaning me). 

I said this because she would 
1) incessantly complain/get angry about the same situation and vent to me. We all need an outlet to vent but, I was feeling like a bit of a punching bag at times and 
2) she would often compliment me in ways like ‘you’re very open minded, even though you’re white’ or ‘you’re understanding, even though you’re white’. (She’s non-white.)

She lost it, told me I was ‘just like every other white person’ and I was no different to them etc. She said I had the ‘ability to not be like them’ but I wasn’t there yet, etc. 

She then said she didn’t want to hear from me again. I pointed out that she’d have to, seeing as I’d gotten an STD test at her request and I’d need to tell her the results in two weeks. She agreed. 

I then went on to send her quite a long message. I basically said that I rarely told people how much they meant to me until they’d already left my life. You can imagine the rest - just telling her she was a great girl etc. 

She didn’t read the message for a week and by then, I deleted it so I didn’t have to look at it anymore. I don’t know if she ever read it. 

Now, as I realise I’ll have to message her about my results, I kind of regret being so nice and complimentary while she threw insults at me. I mean, this was a girl who repeatedly gave out to me for how I styled my own hair, who used my skin colour as a way to insult other people who looked like me, told me I should be showering at least twice a day instead of once (thanks mom?) and insinuated that I was closed minded for not wanting to have a threesome with my sister and her. She even had the audacity to judge my minor habits (late nights and junk food) when she took every drug under the sun and I made sure never to judge her for it. 

She was bizarrely open minded and highly judgmental at the same time, and the more I look back, the more I realise I had a bad feeling early on (I left our second date after sex because I had a bad feeling in my gut about it). 

Is it petty and dumb that I actually regret being so nice to her as she was dumping me? Would it be ridiculous if me to be honest about how I feel about her when I message her again, given that she didn’t hold back raising her opinions of me and my race? Am I super petty for thinking this? 

For clarification - this would basically serve no purpose but make me feel way better. 

Tl;Dr - I was very polite during a breakup when she was very rude and derogatory. I now really regret letting her tell me what she really thought of me, and stopping myself doing the same.",t2_1eghpveg,False,,0,False,Should I [20F] tell my ex [20F] how I really feel about her?

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I lost my temper (verbally, not physically - it was over text). She had rung me at 1am the night before while on cocaine, because she was horny. I hadn’t answered but had gotten a serious fright because, my dad had a severe heart attack that day the year before and a call at 1am made me think he was sick again. I was also in the middle of stressful exams (final year of uni). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was complaining repeatedly about issues she was having with her college and I eventually lost it and told her, I wished she’d ‘aim this anger’ at somebody who could actually change things in her college and ‘not just some white girl’ (meaning me). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said this because she would 
1) incessantly complain/get angry about the same situation and vent to me. We all need an outlet to vent but, I was feeling like a bit of a punching bag at times and 
2) she would often compliment me in ways like ‘you’re very open minded, even though you’re white’ or ‘you’re understanding, even though you’re white’. (She’s non-white.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She lost it, told me I was ‘just like every other white person’ and I was no different to them etc. She said I had the ‘ability to not be like them’ but I wasn’t there yet, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then said she didn’t want to hear from me again. I pointed out that she’d have to, seeing as I’d gotten an STD test at her request and I’d need to tell her the results in two weeks. She agreed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went on to send her quite a long message. I basically said that I rarely told people how much they meant to me until they’d already left my life. You can imagine the rest - just telling her she was a great girl etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t read the message for a week and by then, I deleted it so I didn’t have to look at it anymore. I don’t know if she ever read it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I realise I’ll have to message her about my results, I kind of regret being so nice and complimentary while she threw insults at me. I mean, this was a girl who repeatedly gave out to me for how I styled my own hair, who used my skin colour as a way to insult other people who looked like me, told me I should be showering at least twice a day instead of once (thanks mom?) and insinuated that I was closed minded for not wanting to have a threesome with my sister and her.

Well, early this year, I met a girl, it was a very fun story and she had interest in me since the beggining, we had a affair and continued seeing each other for about a month, we got really close to each other (comparing to the amount of time we spend together) and then we just, apparently with no reason, started getting far and more far away from each other.
I still was making a effort to text her sometimes, when I tried calling her to make something, always something got in our way and we never had seen each other again.
Passing another month, I saw she tagging someone on some cute Facebook posts, and the next day, she posted a picture with that guy on the Whatsapp status with some hearts "" and so it begins, 1 year and 8 months of pure friendship"", from that day on, I never texted her anymore, and she also did the same.
After sometime, she blocked me from seeing her status on Whatsapp, and like a month after that, a friend of mine sent me a screenshot of her status, with a love letter asking ""do you want to be my girlfriend?"", and then I sent her some messages, I was looking for a fight, we had a little fight and then we don't talked with each other anymore.
After sometime, she found me at a square and asked for forgiveness and said that wanted to still be my friend, we started talking with each other constantly in a friendly way for like... 3 months.
And then, she enrolled at a short course (a 2 weeks course) on a technicall school I study, and on her first day of class, she told 2 of my friends that she still had feelings for me, and everytime she sees me, she feels like kissing me, and that I was always so close to her, and her boyfriend was at the nearby city.
After that she told me all of that, and almost kissed me a 2days after it(I didn't let her do it), and then, one day she had the brilliant idea of calling me to a discord call with her boyfriend, that day I had a tantrum, and we fought again.

,dating_advice,"Exactly what the title says, I feel sad when I see girls I find attractive. I understand this is probably due to a confidence thing and me immediately assuming I could never get with said hot girls but I don't know how to stop doing that. I don't say it with a whole lot of confidence but I know I'm an attractive guy and I think I can be kind of charming sometimes so what gives? Why can't I stop thinking these girls are out of my league when I know they aren't?

It's got to the point now where I'm scared to go to clubs in case I see a girl I think is hot and it ruins my night, because if I do I'll spend the entire time I'm there looking back at them trying to convince myself they aren't as hot as I think they are, rather than actually trying to go and talk to them, like where are you even meant to start? All my exes came as a result of them having the balls to go talk to me, I'm yet to have actually got a girlfriend through my own ability.

I think seeing hot girls also makes me afraid as I have somewhat of a niche requirement for me to find a girl hot so it's kind of rare I'll see a girl and think she's my kind of attractive, so when it doesn't work out with one of them I then freak out wondering when I'm next gonna find someone who's my kind of attractive, where I'll then end up desperately swiping through Tinder looking for someone at 3am after spending 2 hours in the club, lol.

Basically, I just wanna know how to break free from these negative thought patterns and turn that sad, anxious feeling when I see hot girls into excitement at the chance I can get their number. Thanks!

,dating_advice,"I met a guy on Hinge a month ago. I was coming out of a bad situation with someone I had a few dates with, and he seemed really nice. We chatted a little bit on the app and texted, and he asked me if I wanted to have coffee or just come over and drink tea. I was feeling a little sad and it was cold out, so I just went directly over there. We watched a romantic comedy, kissed, cuddled, and ended up messing around but not having sex. His apartment wasn't clean, basically his kitchen and bathroom looked as though he rarely if ever swept, cleaned the toilet/sink, wiped the counters. His pots and pans were on the stove and weren't clean, so I wasn't comfortable eating the canned soup I brought and had to order takeout. He made a comment that I felt like his place wasn't clean enough, and I told him outright it wasn't but didn't bring it up ever again. I liked him a lot and didn't want to make a huge deal. He was so cute and nice, a good kisser, and made me feel good. I liked talking to him.

It turns out he was really sick. He had cancelled on me before due to this, but he was coughing a lot and just seemed very unwell. I stayed and held him because I felt bad for him, but declined spending the night or having sex.

He asked me to come back the next night, so I did. He was still sick. I went down on him. I enjoyed that and didn't want to do more than that. Two days later he asked me to go to the movies with him. He was resting his head on my shoulder and holding my hand, and coughing a lot. He had to get up several times, I guess due to his coughing and he said his stomach was hurting. I went home with him and we almost had sex, but I didn't feel right with him being sick and his apartment not being clean. Other than this, he was a really nice, cute guy and I felt flattered that he wanted to see me multiple times that week.

The following week I asked if I could see him again, and he said okay but only to hook up because he really just wanted to play video games. I said fine, but it was pretty bad because he didn't seem like he wanted me there and only talked to me out of guilt. I did go down on him a couple times and I left. I enjoyed doing it, but not how he was acting.

Since then, he has said he needs space and doesn't know what he wants. I haven't seen him in two weeks, only talk via text sprodically. He said we can talk again in a few weeks over the holidays and maybe text here and there, but not see one another. Last night he said he wants to be friends and even asked me if I wanted a sleepover sometime, to which I said yes, then he blocked me on Whatsapp the next day. I sent him a text message asking him what was wrong, why he blocked me on there, and he said I didn't do anything wrong, but he didn't like me asking him questions and he just wanted space. HE said he was not in a relationship and that he thinks I am kind and interesting, he likes me, wants me for more than sex, but he can't deal with all the emotions of our interactions and needs a break. I never had sex with him and wonder if that's all he wanted.

,dating_advice,"Hello as title suggests I am trying to figure out the best way to break things off with the guy I am seeing.

**Background:** We have been together for 18months ish. We met on tinder in my hometown and immediately hit it off. We saw each other 5 times a week for about 4 months until I had to head back to school across the country. Coincidentally he was also moving to that part of the country around the same time so we continued to see each other. This time we only saw each other 2 times a month because we were about 3 hours away from each other (transit wise - neither of us had a car). I finished my degree in May and moved back to my hometown in June, we still talk daily but are too broke to see each other.

He is a super great human but neither of us were/are invested enough to make the move cross country to be with each other, mainly because we both have pretty decent jobs in our respective fields and recent cuts would make it impossible to find something similar elsewhere. Its just shitty timing, and I am sad. At this point I can no longer do this long distance thing, I am honestly sure he feels the same. I just don't have the guts (or I may be too stubborn) to cut things off and I need encouragement.

&lt;p&gt;He is a super great human but neither of us were/are invested enough to make the move cross country to be with each other, mainly because we both have pretty decent jobs in our respective fields and recent cuts would make it impossible to find something similar elsewhere. Its just shitty timing, and I am sad. At this point I can no longer do this long distance thing, I am honestly sure he feels the same. I just don&amp;#39;t have the guts (or I may be too stubborn) to cut things off and I need encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be great. I also feel like writing this helps me get over this hurdle too but maybe some internet strangers can also help too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy to answer any questions if you need more info or if this is too vague&lt;/p&gt;

We decided to take things slowly. Well. Some things. Being friends for so long, I’d already met her parents. Her kids already knew me. A week after our first date I asked her if she was planning on seeing anyone else whilst we were dating. She said no. She also said she wanted me to be her boyfriend. It felt a little soon but it was what I wanted too and it seemed the next inevitable step anyway if we were discussing exclusivity. 

A few weeks go by and she starts getting pretty distant. Very little effort on her part was being put in. I asked her what was wrong and she got real defensive about the way that I asked. Said she’s a busy person and just because she isn’t texting back doesn’t mean something is wrong. 

It did, actually. I brought it up again a week later after no improvement saying her abrupt change in communication style is worrying and it feels like something is wrong. She replied saying she isn’t sure if we rushed unto things too quick. Labels too soon. Not ready for anything full on. 

Over about 5 hours I managed to get about 4messages out of her. Not the most helpful dialogue I’ve ever had. A bit frustrated, I laid it all on the table. I told her I wasn’t looking for something casual, I was looking to grow something real and long lasting. No guarantees that She and I would manage that but after a long ass, deadend relationship in my past, I refuse to settle for anything less. I said that Id give her some space to figure out what she wants. If she wants to take a step back but still see where things go, I’m willing to be patient. If she just simply isn’t into me, then I’d probably need some time before we tried to go back to being friends. No pressure. No obligation. Just to let me know what she wants to do. She didn’t reply. 

Anyway, that was Monday. That was the last time I spoke to her. 

Right now I’m wondering what I should do. I was feeling pretty good for a few days not stressing about why she wasn’t texting all day etc but now I’m getting pretty pissed. She claims to have cared about me, still wanted to be in my life. But doesn’t make the effort to get closure on us. It feels pretty over, despite her seeming unwillingness to say it.

,dating_advice,"Hey everybody, this is my first reddit post so yay!

So here’s my story:

I met her on the train. We locked eyes. Complimented her on her shoes. That got a conversation started.

I decided to be a romantic about it. Before I got off at my stop, I wrote down a brief note and gave her my number.

A week later I get a text from her on Thanksgiving Night. The text mirrors the format of my note. “Dear....,” followed by multiple short paragraphs, then “best...”

I respond in kind, and we’ve been having these thoughtful text conversations, finding out about each other little by little, always keeping the notes thoughtful and warm.

She’s elusive about one thing though: actually setting a date to meet up in person. 

But isn’t shy about implying we will eventually meet. 

So on the one hands she says things like “I look forward to talking about that when we meet...” but then when it comes to setting a time to meet, she goes, “I’ll let you know if I am free.”

So the last message I sent was simple and to the point:

“When you are ready, let me know of times and dates that work for you. Blessings, [me]”

It’s the shortest message in the entire conversation. Usually it takes her between 6-12 hours to respond (I’ve been keeping up a similar rhythm with her).

,dating_advice,"(Long Post)

I met this girl through a dating app. We were texting for a few days and she seemed to be very interested in me through her texts and replies. I asked whether she uses the dating app for fun and she said initially she was until she found me. Few pick up lines here and there. And she don't seem to be the one who entertain any guys. I don't really go out with girls often until I am really sure she is interested. There was this one time when she was planning to have a meal and I jokingly said why am I not invited. She asked me to come to her uni. I told her if the place was outside of her uni, I would have came. She instantly text back saying, if so I want to eat outside.

So I asked her out to treat her as her birthday is coming. She asked whether I would be bringing my friends and I said no. I asked her back the same thing and she gave the same answer. When I arrived at her place to pick her up, she said would I mind if her roommate tag along as she was told by her mom to bring one of her friends as she was worried. I didn't mind and agreed.

Expectation and reality differs guys. I expect her to be fun and outgoing through her texts. Turned out I was the one initiating the conversation everytime. Her roommate seemed to be more interested in talking, more than her.

When we were having dinner, we barely talked much. I tried many times to initiate a conversation but none last long. I finally gave up as I felt frustrated. She kept looking at her phone on her instagram homepage. She was just staring and dreaming at it most of the time. I saw it cuz she placed her phone on the table.

The drive back to her place was awkward as I gave up trying. I felt frustrated and I guess they knew.

What advice do I need?

I am still doubtful whether she was shy or she really wasn't interested. I can tell going on a date seems new to her. However, the signs I am getting is really getting on my veins. I didn't force you to go out with me girl. But it might just be my wild imaginations.

But one thing is for sure. I've learned a valuable lesson. Don't be hooked up to a partner online. Always proceed to a date to see whether he/she is really the one. Otherwise, your time would be wasted. She followed me on instagram first after days of not texting on the dating app. And luckily I went out with her on the first week itself. I told myself that there is no harm dating a girl who seems to be interested in me. Unfortunately, dates might not always be fruitful.

,dating_advice,"hi guys, girls
This question goes to anybody who has gone trough any similar experience, or think that may have an advice on the matter.
3 years ago I started talking to a girl on instagram. She was incredibly receptive to my messages and we got along very well. Turns out she had a boyfriend. When I
found out, I kind of thought that was a lost cause, and just writed something like ""if you feel like missing me just talk to me on whatsapp"". A day later or so I got a new message; it was from her.
From that point on we started talking a lot, and the ""only reason"" we didn't see each other was because of her boyfriend; who she doesn't want to betray.
Anyway, in that time we did some sexting and nude sending (????) but we never got to see each other. She wanted to stop talking to me because she wanted to stop doing things ""wrong"" but she couldn't and neither did I. So we keep talking for a few months. One day she made up her mind and we stop talking.
I thought it was the end - but it wasn't. A few months later I reacted to some instagram story she uploaded, and we started going down the same road again. Texting, calls, nudes, talking about the way we feel with each other. Then we stop talking again; never got to actually see each other. 
A few months later, again. Bla bla bla, but this time she invited me to go to her graduation party, and see her face to face for the very first time. Still, her boyfriend was around, so we kind of talk to each other very quickly and see each other from the distance - nothing else happened, of course.
a week after that she invited me to go to another graduation party - his boyfriend wouldn't be around -  I said yes but I have a transport fault on the way and I couldn't make it - she was very sad (and so was I). We talked for a few more months and I decided we needed to stop talking.
Then, guess what? We've started talking again. And we got to see each other on a mall, but it was nearby her house so we couldn't be very close or ""suspicious"". We had a really good time, but that was it. LAter we wanted to see each other again, but she says that she cannot ""dissapear"" without telling her family and boyfriend were she is going - she is constantly reporting where she is going, to do what, so she cannot dissapear without giving explanations. Her best friends doesn't know anything about this so she cannot even make an alabi.
We've been on and off and on and off. I dont know what to do; i dont know if there's actually anything to do. I really like her, and she says she likes me too. That she feels in a very special way with me. She says she want to be with me, fuck me, and I don't know if I should keep trying, or if there's a trick to it or a way out.
Has anybody of you ever been in a similar situation? It's been years now, so Im pretty sure it's clearly not a whim or so.

I thought it was the end - but it wasn&amp;#39;t. A few months later I reacted to some instagram story she uploaded, and we started going down the same road again. Texting, calls, nudes, talking about the way we feel with each other. Then we stop talking again; never got to actually see each other. 
A few months later, again. Bla bla bla, but this time she invited me to go to her graduation party, and see her face to face for the very first time. Still, her boyfriend was around, so we kind of talk to each other very quickly and see each other from the distance - nothing else happened, of course.
a week after that she invited me to go to another graduation party - his boyfriend wouldn&amp;#39;t be around -  I said yes but I have a transport fault on the way and I couldn&amp;#39;t make it - she was very sad (and so was I). We talked for a few more months and I decided we needed to stop talking.
Then, guess what? We&amp;#39;ve started talking again. And we got to see each other on a mall, but it was nearby her house so we couldn&amp;#39;t be very close or &amp;quot;suspicious&amp;quot;. We had a really good time, but that was it. LAter we wanted to see each other again, but she says that she cannot &amp;quot;dissapear&amp;quot; without telling her family and boyfriend were she is going - she is constantly reporting where she is going, to do what, so she cannot dissapear without giving explanations. Her best friends doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about this so she cannot even make an alabi.
We&amp;#39;ve been on and off and on and off. I dont know what to do; i dont know if there&amp;#39;s actually anything to do. I really like her, and she says she likes me too. That she feels in a very special way with me. She says she want to be with me, fuck me, and I don&amp;#39;t know if I should keep trying, or if there&amp;#39;s a trick to it or a way out.
Has anybody of you ever been in a similar situation? It&amp;#39;s been years now, so Im pretty sure it&amp;#39;s clearly not a whim or so.
Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Ok theres a lot to this relationship between me \[20M\] and her \[19F\], but I'll try to keep it as consise as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So this girl was one of my first friends I made in the dorms last year in college, shes insanely cute, goth, famous on tiktok, huge social media presense (so yeah shes an e-girl, which I didnt even know was even really a thing until I met her).

And then theres me, standard white boy, no social media presense at all, and someone who normally made fun of tiktok and goths.

So last year it was fairly obvious we liked eachother but nothing could really happen between us because her roommate had a huge crush on me so we kinda just fizzled into standard friends.

Now come to this year we are still friends with a good amount of sexual tension but shes the type of girl to never initiate anything (as am I), and then add onto that that everytime we would hang out I would also be with all her friends and they would be drunk and give me a lot of attention and that would really piss her off (rightfully so) so I kinda thought I had lost all chance with her.

That was until yesterday where like 2 of her friends texted me out of the blue at the same time saying ""\[her name\] wants to fuck you""

Now she doesnt even know Im a kissless virgin because on 2 seperate occasions other girls have lied to her saying we've had sex for some attention seeking reasons I guess, but I really want this girl to be my first and I have really no idea how to make this happen without it being super awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

I know Ive just been rambling on and theres a shit ton more to this situation that Ive left out, but what Im asking is: How do I (a guy with really no experience and is horrible socially) make it happen with this girl (whos also pretty horrible socially, but with a ton of experience?)

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this girl was one of my first friends I made in the dorms last year in college, shes insanely cute, goth, famous on tiktok, huge social media presense (so yeah shes an e-girl, which I didnt even know was even really a thing until I met her).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then theres me, standard white boy, no social media presense at all, and someone who normally made fun of tiktok and goths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last year it was fairly obvious we liked eachother but nothing could really happen between us because her roommate had a huge crush on me so we kinda just fizzled into standard friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now come to this year we are still friends with a good amount of sexual tension but shes the type of girl to never initiate anything (as am I), and then add onto that that everytime we would hang out I would also be with all her friends and they would be drunk and give me a lot of attention and that would really piss her off (rightfully so) so I kinda thought I had lost all chance with her.&lt;/p&gt;

TL;DR: 
Met a guy and we were supposed to just be hooking up. Exchanged numbers, talked every day, both of us were really into each other. Got cockblocked by the weatherman. Realized we wouldn’t see each other for awhile. Told guy we should keep contact strictly to making plans to hang out. Regretting that decision.

Almost two months ago, my cousin introduced me to his friend. We’ll call him K. They were staying at my house for the weekend to go hunting. K and I actually really hit it off, hooked up, and had crazy good chemistry. We talked about potentially dating, but we’re both super busy with life right now and there’s a 4 hour drive between us. It’s just a “right guy, wrong time” situation. Regardless, we exchanged phone numbers and texted each other every day. 

Fast forward to this past weekend. Long story short, on Sunday night while K and I were having sex, my cousin abruptly called up the stairs and told K that they were leaving ASAP because the weather was supposed to be bad. K comes back to bed, he finishes in no more than 2 minutes, and I’m left disappointed. Especially considering neither of us got any of the bad weather that was called for, so I basically got cockblocked by the weatherman.

The disappointment kind of carried into the week and it became apparent that we wouldn’t be able to make plans until after the New Year at the very earliest. So that just added to the disappointment and it was kind of getting me down.

Then I remembered that we aren’t dating, so I really have no reason to be disappointed like that, but I also realized that part of the reason I was disappointed was because we talk every single day. We’re both really into each other, we both like talking to each other, we like spending time together, and we like hooking up. BUT WE AREN’T DATING. So I did what I thought was most logical and told him that I thought it was best if we didn’t talk as much and that we should keep our contact to making plans to hang out.

,dating_advice,"Throwaway for obvious reasons...


Here's the backstory: I work at a bar in a very busy city in Florida that I've only worked at for about 6 months. My boss (bar manager who we'll call Katie) and I work side by side on Friday, Saturday, and some Sunday nights and became pretty close over the past couple months. One Sunday night after a long weekend we hung out at a bar across the street and had quite a few drinks together. Needless to say, she went home with me that night. Now here's where the trouble starts...

 A few days later on my night off she randomly showed up at my apartment. No call, no text, nothing. I was taken aback by this not necessarily in a bad way...but really, wtf Katie? I tried hinting around that night about how much of a bad idea it was to date your boss, but she just blew it off. Ever since that night she texts me often, almost  like we are together. 

I should also mention that a former employee who we'll call Mike had a huge crush on Katie. He kept it to himself for the most part, but you know bars- word gets around quick. She found out and  ended up firing him because of it (she used him being late once as an excuse). She told me one night that she did it because she was ""uncomfortable working near him"". Understand that Katie is very attractive and a lot of guys like her, customers and the few male employees that work there are always flirting with her. But she acted like Mike liking her was so awful and bad and that he was wrong, but not her for firing him.

So, Monday when the new schedules were put up I noticed that both me and Katie were off on Friday (tonight) and that's unheard of since I haven'thad a Friday off since I started. I called her to ask why. She said it's so we can both have a night off and hang out together. She never even asked me if I wanted to, either. I would've said no. Friday and Saturday nights are our money makers. I was speechless after that and didn't want to say anything that would come back to hurt me. If I ghost her or end it with her then I know she will probably find a way to fire me, and that's what I'm scared of. I love this job, I need this job. She has also told a couple of the other girls at work that we are dating. As far as I'm concerned we are not and never were. 


Now, I hope this doesn't offend anyone, but all she really is to me is a friend I sleep with or fuck buddy. We've all been there, right? But it's obvious she wants more and I just...don't. I fully enjoy my single life and do not need or want any attatchments right now. 

I am supposed to meet up with her at 9pm tonight and I do plan on going, but I really, REALLY need advice on what to say to her to make it clear that I don't feel that way about her right now. What do I say to let her down easy? I'm usually really good at giving advice for these things, but when my job is at stake I really need to tread very carefully...",t2_5665chnp,False,,0,False,"Started sleeping with my boss, now I might lose my job..NEED ADVICE!",[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,False,t3_e75gw2,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575699330.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway for obvious reasons...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the backstory: I work at a bar in a very busy city in Florida that I&amp;#39;ve only worked at for about 6 months. My boss (bar manager who we&amp;#39;ll call Katie) and I work side by side on Friday, Saturday, and some Sunday nights and became pretty close over the past couple months. One Sunday night after a long weekend we hung out at a bar across the street and had quite a few drinks together. Needless to say, she went home with me that night. Now here&amp;#39;s where the trouble starts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later on my night off she randomly showed up at my apartment. No call, no text, nothing. I was taken aback by this not necessarily in a bad way...but really, wtf Katie? I tried hinting around that night about how much of a bad idea it was to date your boss, but she just blew it off. Ever since that night she texts me often, almost  like we are together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that a former employee who we&amp;#39;ll call Mike had a huge crush on Katie. He kept it to himself for the most part, but you know bars- word gets around quick. She found out and  ended up firing him because of it (she used him being late once as an excuse). She told me one night that she did it because she was &amp;quot;uncomfortable working near him&amp;quot;. Understand that Katie is very attractive and a lot of guys like her, customers and the few male employees that work there are always flirting with her. But she acted like Mike liking her was so awful and bad and that he was wrong, but not her for firing him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Monday when the new schedules were put up I noticed that both me and Katie were off on Friday (tonight) and that&amp;#39;s unheard of since I haven&amp;#39;thad a Friday off since I started. I called her to ask why. She said it&amp;#39;s so we can both have a night off and hang out together. She never even asked me if I wanted to, either. I would&amp;#39;ve said no. Friday and Saturday nights are our money makers. I was speechless after that and didn&amp;#39;t want to say anything that would come back to hurt me. If I ghost her or end it with her then I know she will probably find a way to fire me, and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m scared of. I love this job, I need this job. She has also told a couple of the other girls at work that we are dating. As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned we are not and never were. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I hope this doesn&amp;#39;t offend anyone, but all she really is to me is a friend I sleep with or fuck buddy. We&amp;#39;ve all been there, right? But it&amp;#39;s obvious she wants more and I just...don&amp;#39;t. I fully enjoy my single life and do not need or want any attatchments right now. &lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"I’m not looking to be chastised, so please don’t comment if that’s your intent. 

I cheated on my now-ex in the last few months of our relationship and it took me about 3 months to officially end things. I knew that the relationship was over, but I felt pressured to stay because he would beg me to give him another chance. 

In those three months, I cheated (let’s call him John). When I broke up with my ex, John and I continued to spend time together, and still do so today. We have gotten to the point of being exclusive with each other. 

Yes, I moved on quickly. But I was already checked out of my previous relationship. I have also always believed that people move on their own pace. 

The dark cloud above this is: I asked John if this was going to go anywhere, in hopes of us becoming official. He hesitated and said “I don’t know. Long-term, I just don’t think I can forget how long it took for you to break things up with your ex. That was really fucked up. But I didn’t think I was going to like you this much a few months ago and I don’t know what it will be like a few months from now. I really enjoy spending time with you and being around you.” Of course my heart sank and I’ve been in a wave of sadness since. 

My question is for those who is the John in this situation. Did you ever get to the point where you wanted a relationship with the Me in this situation? What happened or changed your mind? What can I do to make it better, or is this something that I should not get my hopes up for?

,dating_advice,"For the past five or so years now, I've been single.  Not in a sort of single way where I have some girlfriends that come and go, but in a single way where I'm just eternally alone.

Before this time, I had a fun girlfriend and we got along great.  But she got a job in another town on the other side of the country.  We thought we might try to make it work long distance, but it just didn't.  I've been alone ever since.  

I can't complain about the rest of my life, I have a really cool job and make good money.  I own my house, I have a nice car, I feel like I'm a fun person and have some cool hobbies.  Even though, it's often alone, I travel a lot and have made good friends in backpackers hostels all over the world that I still keep in touch with.

But all of this would be so much cooler if I had someone to share it with.  It doesn't even have to be anything serious!  Just someone to hang with and have fun with and maybe be intimate with sometimes would be cool.  I'd like a future and maybe would like to get married one day, but I guess I'll wait and see if it's the right person first.  I just can't meet any ladies at all to find out if they're the right person!

I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I have a cool life and am a charismatic guy, but nothing works.  I even feel like I'm an objectively good looking guy too.  I'm six feet tall with good features and I am in great shape because I run and go to the gym all the time.  I have no idea what it could be.

I've literally done everything I can possibly think of or have had recommended to me.  I get nice haircuts, I keep my wardrobe updated and nice, I volunteer, I go to hobbyist meetups, I go to board game nights, I've tried apps and sites.  I could go on and on.  I get advice from my female friends about things to say, how to dress, where to go, all sorts of things.  I try to use all of their advice and can't get anywhere.  

I've even tried the approach of ""not trying.""  I've gone for months without letting the idea of meeting someone come into my mind.  It does help in helping me focus on more positive things and staying happier for the most part, but it's tough to not let little reminders seep through when I see a friend with someone or whatever.

At the end of the day, the best I can assume is maybe having someone around is perhaps not a part of life that I should expect anymore.  I'm trying not to be too hard on myself, but all the factors at hand are just telling me in a practical way that I am not worthy or deserving of having someone around.

I'd like to be positive and thing that I am worthy and deserving.  I really, truly think that I am.  But the hard facts are that no one else seems to think so.  I've done everything that I can, so I just have to assume that it's entirely out of my control.

At this point, I'm considering putting it entirely out of my mind and just going with the fact that I'll be alone my entire life.  I do have fun stuff going on and good friends, I guess it wouldn't be so bad.

But before I give up, I guess my question is: Should I?  I'm 35, I'm not getting any younger or any more good looking.  It might be time to give up the fantasy at this point.  I feel like I would be happier to accept the isolation and celibacy and not even make getting out of it a goal or a thought at all.  I don't want to do that, but it's becoming more and more obvious I may not have much of a choice if I want to have a happy life.

This annoyed me because I proposed the date the week before and she had all that time to do her work. Also she said that she could most likely go the 2 times I asked to confirm the plans.

,dating_advice,"So I \[F20\] went out on a first date with a guy \[22\] I'd met off of tinder yesterday. We had been texting back and forth for a while and decided to meet up. We went for dinner and to a few bars. I'd said he could stay at my place since it was closer to his work, where he was headed in the morning, than travelling back home. However, before we met up I said that I don't have sex on the first date due to being led on in the past and he said he was fine with this.

We went out and were having a really good time, at least in my opinion. The conversation flowed just as well in person as it did via text and I think(?) he was attracted to me.

We went back to my place and watched a movie. We started making out and he started to take things further than I was comfortable with. I told him to stop and reminded him I don't have sex on the first date. He stopped and we just ended up cuddling for the rest of the night. His hands would wander slightly over my ass and my breasts but I didn't really mind.

We woke up early the next morning and started making out heavily. I was kind of enjoying it and was maybe comfortable with going further with him the next time we met. He then pulled up my shirt and started sucking on one of my nipples, which I began to feel uncomfortable with and told him to stop. He did and was fine with doing so and we lay there talking and cuddling until he left.

Once he left I asked him if he wanted to go on a second date and he said no because he felt that he was staying at my place so that we could have sex, even though I told him that wouldn't happen. He said he was put off me due to the fact that I didn't have sex with him, even though I'd stated otherwise.

I've been upset and been feeling guilty in thinking that maybe I did lead him on and that I should have just let him go home after the date instead of taking him to my place.

I'm (26F) having trouble moving on from something that never happened a long time ago with a guy (27M) I met when we were teenagers. I was a sophomore in high school and he was a junior who went to another local high school. We met from piano lessons and would always talk for a few minutes before his private lesson after mine. To me, all of our interactions felt like the perfect dream. We had amazing chemistry when we were hanging out that his or my friends would think we were in a serious relationship. Stupid teenage me thought that he was the perfect match (we found out we even lived a couple blocks apart ffs!) Our piano teacher and some of my friends shipped us so hard. We hung out a lot over the course of two years before he graduated. I was never sure of how he felt for me, but I knew I didn't like him like a typical teenage crush. It was totally different...like the whole nine yards of stupid fictional romantic themes (Mr perfect, love at first sight, butterflies, etc). A year later, I came clean about how I felt and he had admitted to me that there were several times where he did want to kiss me, but he had a gf of two years at the time. I respected that and we both backed off. That never stopped me from thinking what could have been if she hadn't been in the picture. She ended up cheating on him later and that basically ruined his trust in women. Both of us didn't really talk or keep in touch after that, just the usual Facebook/Instagram updates. He got into another relationship for a couple years but that ended. I went off to college, dated some people and had a couple serious relationships, but my stupid brain could not stop comparing the experiences.
 

Just yesterday, he messaged me out of the blue and wanted to grab dinner. I was most definitely holding back because I wasn't sure at this point and I could feel that he was too. I asked him why he wanted to hang out after all these years. I told him that he knew I used to like him, so what did he want. He said that he met a girl on tinder that reminded him of someone (me). She urged him to contact me because there was nothing to lose, so he wanted to ""catch up with an old friend"". We talked about the past and he was interested in my exes (why? If you're 'catching up with an old friend'). Anyway, rest of the conversation about our past and it seems that he had forgotten about the past, except to remember that we had many laughs etc. Is he just intentionally not admitting something here? I'm confused and worry that I overthought this one and maybe he really just wants to 'catch up with an old friend'. If that's the case, I'm offended and I should move on even though it sucks.

mutual &gt;&gt;&gt; platonic &gt;&gt;&gt; romantic

or

mutual &gt;&gt;&gt; frenemy &gt;&gt;&gt; perma-ghosted

CONCLUSION:

any comment saying that this method of dating is wrong automatically disqualifies you as a failure to the territory of LOVE.

TLDR:

how do you approach the scene of dating?

is it either...

""a game to get laid"" and start a relationship from there?

or

Him: really? Cuz I never heard ur name. 
Me: yeah, maybe cuz this isn't a genuine account, but please don't unfriend this; there's no malicious intent behind this. Him: may I please know your name, if you don't mind? Or at least where do u know me from?

Him: I'm just curious. 
Me: it's natural 
Him: what do you want? 
Me: nothing. 
Him: Goodbye then, plus don't send everyone friend requests its not healthy. He then blocked the account.

I decided to move on from my little crush. Also, ever since this FB incident I made it a point to not gaze at him longingly cuz he'd find out THE FAKE FB ACCOUNT was me, but.. once he noticed me staring at him.
I was talking to a friend at that time and wasn't even paying attention to what my eyes were fixated on, but soon I realized I was staring into his soul and he was staring back with a quizzical expression on his face. I darted my eyes away quickly.

After this I found him staring at me many times. He'd always notice me when he'd enter class and got kinda awkward around me (he's really shy and can't even give a presentation in front of the class). I have a feeling he knows it was me.

Anyway, I forgot about this whole thing cuz it wasn't going anywhere... but now I've noticed that: he dresses up better around me and HE HAS UNBLOCKED MY FAKE ACCOUNT ON FB.

,dating_advice," 

Hello Redditors, I need some dating advice about a girl I'm seeing that I really like.  I (Male 30) have been single for about 1 year now, and have been fairly active on the dating scene.  I'm on an online dating app ""Hinge"" and have found success on it.  I've also found some success in meeting girls the ""old fashioned"" way. 

Normally when I meet a girl, 1 of 2 things happen.  Either I simply don't find them someone I want to see again (for any reason) and it goes no further than the first date.  OR, I do like them to some degree and will propose another date.  If we do hang out again, usually within about 2-3 dates total, I realize that this person isn't for me.  We then subsequently move on, kindly.

Here is where I need the help.  A month ago, on November 7th, I matched a girl on Hinge.  We had common interests, were from the same city, same age, etc.  We exchanged numbers, and set up a date to meet the next night, at a speakeasy type of bar. 

Instantly, I felt an attraction, or a magnetic pull towards her.  A rare feeling I haven't felt since I met my ex for the first time.  We hit it off.  Conversation was great.  We even found out we went to the same high school.  She was the grade above me (31), and we shared several mutual friends and acquaintances.  This opened up an entire new dimension to everything.  However, we didn't remember each other at all, initially.  I looked very different in high school, and she did as well.  I'd like to say we've blossomed since then.  Haha.

Anyways, the night was great.  We spent the night together, considering it was an absolutely wonderful date.  It seemed as if we were both coming from the same place in our love lives.  Both somewhat recently out of relationships, we both had the same goal as to what we were looking for at this point in our lives.  We'd love to meet someone to marry and start a family with, but until then, we just want to have fun.  We both agreed we didn't want to get into another relationship with the wrong person again.  We even talked about our bad dating experiences in the past.  She told me about some guy who was a total creep to her, and she doesn't know how to tell him off.  Somewhat meaningless in the overall conversation arch, but he comes into play later on.

So after our amazing first date, we go on several more.  Each one even better than the last.  We have hung out about 6-7 times over the past month.  I have never met someone who makes me smile as much as she does.  I have this growing feeling inside of me that she could be the one.  It just all seems to be there.  It's hard to explain the intricacies of everything, but I've never felt this way, even during the times I've been in love in the past.  This is what makes it so hard.

Everything seemed like we were on the path towards a relationship.  We both kept reminding each other we want to still take things slow, yet how incredibly special we feel with each other (both ways).  She's told me that she's told her friends and family about me, shown them pictures. That I make her feel like she's never felt before. Everything seemed like out of a romantic movie! Until last Saturday.

We had another amazing date on Friday, she slept at my place, and we spend (almost) all of Saturday together.  She made it apparent early on that she couldn't hang out Saturday night because she was going to a show with her girlfriend.  I thought nothing of it.  Until I found out she went to the show with the other guy she mentioned before!

I found out because I knew who he was based on the story she told me previously.  I saw his Instagram page, and he posted a picture of himself at the concert (although she wasn't in the picture).  Nonetheless, this set off an alarm in my mind.  

The next day, we spoke on the phone, and I asked her about where we stand as a ""thing"" or not.  She gave me the same, ""lets just keep enjoying each other and taking it slow, and I could see us being exclusive in the future.""  That's where I put my foot down.  I told her I had a problem with that.  Because I'm giving her the exclusive treatment, yet we aren't exclusive.  When I told her I would feel bad if we were spending all this time together, and she was still seeing other men, that I would feel horrible.  I asked her if she was.  She came clean and said she went to the show with him last night.  But apparently only because he bought the tickets before she ever met me.  I asked her if she hooked up.  She said yes; admitting to having sex with him, because she felt obligated too and was having fun.  She then told me how I'm so much better, and she's sorry, etc.  I was pretty hurt, and I let her know.

I asked her how she would feel if I had done the same to her, especially right after we had spent an amazing 2 days together!  She agreed, and admitted she felt so bad about even being with him at any point in time that night.

I am willing to forgive her and move on, or just dump her all together.  We hung out on Wednesday and talked more.  Things didn't quite seem the same, although I tried to put it behind me.  I gave her 2 options:  Cut things off with the other guy, and we take it slow.  OR we revert to a purely sexual and casual relationship, no more dinner dates or romantic outings.  Just sex and we can see other people.  She didn't like the second option, but ultimately took it because she wanted to cut things off with the other guy on her own terms.  

On top of that, she told me she cant hang out with myself or anyone else for the next 12 days because of finals week in grad school.  I thought that was a bunch of BS.  There's no way she's staying in on Friday and Saturday nights over the next 12 days.  There's no way she isn't going to want sex during that time, or hang out/see anyone.  Yet she exclaims it to be because of school and work, and is not going to be seeing anyone (friend, guy, me, anyone) during that time.  She did say she might want to see me to at night, to workout, or for sex.  I find this unbelievable and hard to believe, considering we were making so many plans before.  We even discussed studying together during this time. (I'm getting ready to take my Real Estate exam).  But no more.  

Yet, with all of this, I still don't know what to do.  Should I keep pursuing her?  Keep being persistent?  Text her or call her to ask if she is free on any give night? Should I just wait it out and let her come to me? Or should I just forget about her for the time being?  See other people, meet other girls, continue doing me as if I never met her?  What should I do?  Please help.",t2_3ul5x9mk,False,,0,False,"Started off great, now I'm confused and can't tell if the flame is dying.

After years passed, we eventually started to call one another “best friends”. By that time, we’ve already been through so much together it felt right.

When you came home for vacation, I was elated to see you. I had my friend, my diary, my peace. As we were getting ready together like old times, I asked you how you were doing and I saw on your face as you said “I’ve been doing good, or whatever” and something just felt off.

“What was so important that he called everybody?”
“Did this dude just ask the location?! Stay 16,000 miles away.”
“Tf?” 
As I dropped you off, and proceeded home he called me again barking requests for a call back as if I was your secretary and as if I was his assistant. I politely took up for you and I said “let him breathe.”

The way you questioned my loyalty and proceeded to get upset with ME sticking up for YOU is something I’ll never understand.

Me and my ex broke up about 2.5 weeks ago. Technically speaking we were never official but to anyone who saw us, including friends, we were together. We only were together about 3.5 months but I hadn’t felt how I felt about her with anyone else in a long, long time.

She had a past of sexual abuses and she opened up to me about it about 2 weeks into us seeing each other and it broke my heart to hear about the things that had happened to her. She always expressed how appreciative she was that I could listen and be so supportive to her.

About a month or so into it she wanted to make it official but I told her I wanted to take things slow, just because I was scared of rushing into it too fast. She was okay with it at the time. We continued on and hung out every day, spending so much time together. About month 2 she asked me again but I was still reserved on it, see I travel a lot for work and she had expressed her doubts about us being able to be together and that scared me. She was okay with making sure we could work. 
About a week before our break up she went and visited family in Florida and went to a motivational conference. She came back and said she is so glad she went and that she was going to be making a lot of changes in her life. I was happy for her. I told her I missed her when she was gone and she lit up, she seemed so happy for me to have said that. I’m not good with expressing my emotions very well.
That weekend was her birthday so we hung out a few times before that, she seemed somewhat distant or that something was bothering her but I didn’t press the issue. I figured if she wanted to talk about it she would. We went out for her birthday that weekend and her mom came and surprised her and I got to meet her. We went out and I wound up taking her and her mom home. Her mom gave me a hug as I left and told me she was so happy and thanked me for being so good to her daughter and taking care of her.

The next day I went over to her house and we hung out all day, she wasn’t acting normal per se but I just kinda assumed she was tired. We were still making thanksgiving plans and New Years plans that day. That night as we went to bed I told her that I do want to be in an relationship with her and that I think we can do it. She smiled and kissed me and we fell asleep. 

The next day, the fateful day she messaged me and asked if she could come over after work, she had things on her mind. I told her of course. She came over and I could just see from her face it wasn’t going to be good. She immediately started crying and told me when she went down and visited her family in Florida and they went to the motivational conference that her sexual assault from 2 years ago came up. Come to find out she had never even told her family about it or dealt with it by going to therapy or anything. She told me that she just wasn’t happy with herself anymore and that she felt like it wasn’t fair for her to rely on me for happiness and that she couldn’t be commuted to anyone until she learned to live herself. She said I was the only man she’s ever been with that she felt deserved the love she could give or that made her feel happy and loved but she just couldn’t right now. She said she wanted to be friends and still hang out but I told her I can’t. Not because I don’t want to but because I just can’t be just friends, I saw her as a lover and a partner and I couldn’t change my feelings for her. She said she understood and reiterated that it was nothing I did or didn’t it was just she could commit to me until she committed to herself first. She said she had plans to go to a therapist. Something she hadn’t done yet since it happened.

It all hit me so sudden when she left, it didn’t feel real. I asked mutual friends and her friends everything and everyone was surprised. She hadn’t told anyone. One of her friends told me she felt she was getting mixed signals from me and it was weighing on her and she was confused she told me I should try to reach out and talk to her again. So I did about a week later and I told her that I don’t want to give up on her or us and told her how I felt towards her, something I struggled to do while we were together. She had said she liked to hear it but she could tell by my actions that I cared. She said that it was kind of messed up that I had never told her my feelings for her until after we broke up but she just couldn’t commit right now because she isn’t happy and doesn’t feel sane. I said okay and said goodbye to her.

I was hurting, I was constantly checking her Snapchat and Instagram, she was still watching all my stuff. In a stupid state of mind I untagged and unliked any pictures I had of hers, in my mind if she didn’t want me in her life I’d leave it. I didn’t think she’d notice and I still don’t know if she did but she unfriended me on Instagram the next day. So I retaliation I Unfriended her on Facebook and Snapchat. She never said anything to me about it. That was on thanksgiving and I wanted to text her and tell her I hope she was good or I guess I hoped she would text me, she never did.

The next day I left for a work trip and I decided to send her a text expressing everything I felt for her the time we were together and how I felt about her. I told her how I felt about the breakup and how sometimes I’m angry but for the most part i just feel sad and hurt by it. It was a long text but in the end I told her I’m not trying to change her mind I just wanted her to know. She was always so adamant on me expressing myself. It’s been 5 days since that text and nothing.
I haven’t reached out and neither has she. Her friends and mutual friends say they don’t know any of the details but from the way she sounded when they talked they said she was done, and that it would probably be best to not reach out and to leave her alone, it’s also worth mentioning that she told me when we talked last that she hadn’t told her friends anything about it.

I know she gave me her reasons as to why she was ending it but I guess I have a hard time with it. I feel like it is my fault somehow. Like if I would’ve committed earlier we would’ve been fine. I feel like I ruined my chances of us ever getting back together. I go through so many emotions, sometimes I’m okay with it because I want her to better herself and get the help she needs and other times I’m angry at her because I feel like she waited until the moment I really opened up to end it, it almost feels vindictive but that would be out of character for her. I’m just so lost and not sure what to do anymore.  I constantly go through the thoughts of “she doesn’t care just move on” and just wondering if she thinks about me too. I miss her more than anything.

She immediately started crying and told me when she went down and visited her family in Florida and they went to the motivational conference that her sexual assault from 2 years ago came up. Come to find out she had never even told her family about it or dealt with it by going to therapy or anything. She told me that she just wasn’t happy with herself anymore and that she felt like it wasn’t fair for her to rely on me for happiness and that she couldn’t be commuted to anyone until she learned to live herself. She said I was the only man she’s ever been with that she felt deserved the love she could give or that made her feel happy and loved but she just couldn’t right now. She said she wanted to be friends and still hang out but I told her I can’t. Not because I don’t want to but because I just can’t be just friends, I saw her as a lover and a partner and I couldn’t change my feelings for her. She said she understood and reiterated that it was nothing I did or didn’t it was just she could commit to me until she committed to herself first. She said she had plans to go to a therapist. Something she hadn’t done yet since it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all hit me so sudden when she left, it didn’t feel real. I asked mutual friends and her friends everything and everyone was surprised. She hadn’t told anyone. One of her friends told me she felt she was getting mixed signals from me and it was weighing on her and she was confused she told me I should try to reach out and talk to her again. So I did about a week later and I told her that I don’t want to give up on her or us and told her how I felt towards her, something I struggled to do while we were together. She had said she liked to hear it but she could tell by my actions that I cared. She said that it was kind of messed up that I had never told her my feelings for her until after we broke up but she just couldn’t commit right now because she isn’t happy and doesn’t feel sane. I said okay and said goodbye to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hurting, I was constantly checking her Snapchat and Instagram, she was still watching all my stuff. In a stupid state of mind I untagged and unliked any pictures I had of hers, in my mind if she didn’t want me in her life I’d leave it. I didn’t think she’d notice and I still don’t know if she did but she unfriended me on Instagram the next day. So I retaliation I Unfriended her on Facebook and Snapchat. She never said anything to me about it. That was on thanksgiving and I wanted to text her and tell her I hope she was good or I guess I hoped she would text me, she never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I left for a work trip and I decided to send her a text expressing everything I felt for her the time we were together and how I felt about her. I told her how I felt about the breakup and how sometimes I’m angry but for the most part i just feel sad and hurt by it. It was a long text but in the end I told her I’m not trying to change her mind I just wanted her to know. She was always so adamant on me expressing myself. It’s been 5 days since that text and nothing.
I haven’t reached out and neither has she. Her friends and mutual friends say they don’t know any of the details but from the way she sounded when they talked they said she was done, and that it would probably be best to not reach out and to leave her alone, it’s also worth mentioning that she told me when we talked last that she hadn’t told her friends anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know she gave me her reasons as to why she was ending it but I guess I have a hard time with it. I feel like it is my fault somehow. Like if I would’ve committed earlier we would’ve been fine. I feel like I ruined my chances of us ever getting back together. I go through so many emotions, sometimes I’m okay with it because I want her to better herself and get the help she needs and other times I’m angry at her because I feel like she waited until the moment I really opened up to end it, it almost feels vindictive but that would be out of character for her. I’m just so lost and not sure what to do anymore.  I constantly go through the thoughts of “she doesn’t care just move on” and just wondering if she thinks about me too. I miss her more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m torn between no contact and trying to be there and be supportive but I dont know if I’ve burned that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"So I posted on here about a month ago about this girl that recently started working with me. Basically I instantly crushed for this girl who got out of a 3yr relationship back in August, right around the time she started working with me. Immediately, we clicked and went from just seeing each other at work, to texting from morning to night, FaceTiming each other frequently until 2-3am, and eventually I slept over her house a couple times and did stuff. She had made it clear that she just wanted a friendship right now and is not ready to date anyone. I have been single for years and feel like I am at a spot to open myself up. Having said that, I was okay with being in a FWB relationship with her, an idea that she suggested. 

Bad idea. I started to catch feelings soon after we started kissing and stuff. She did too, and said that she needed to stop doing stuff with me, and she felt the need to put up boundaries because she was starting to get attached to me. She wants me to just treat her like a friend while she is single and does whatever she wants with whoever she wants, I respect that.

But the thing is, I don’t treat ANY of my friends with as much attention as I’d ever given her. I don’t talk to my friends everyday, I don’t interact with them nearly as much. I’m very busy and while I have previously been able to text her through all the things I do, I could see a decline in my focus and performance in other areas of my life. And earlier this week I decided I needed to put up my own boundaries on her to protect myself. The problem is, now she’s acting cold toward me and like I’m trying to be spiteful and get back at her. The reality is that I am trying to be patient, step back, and let her do her thing without me being there just for attention. I haven’t even been able to have this conversation with her (about my boundaries) because she’s been “too busy” to hang out when I’ve previously asked her. So at this point, I’ve just stepped back without telling her why. I can’t keep doing this. I like her, and I made the mistake of catching feelings for a girl who made it clear she wanted just friends, but she also started to catch feelings and got scared. I understand why she wants to step back, but it also seems like she still wants me to treat her the same way I always had been, but I can’t do that.

I leave for DPT school in less than a year anyway and I don’t think I need to have all this stress in my life over a temporary situation, but I truly care about this girl and would like to see where things could go when she’s in the right spot in her life.

,dating_advice,"Me and my bf met on a random chat app last October and found ourselves liking each other as days go pass by. After 2 weeks, he asked me to be his girlfriend. Even knowing about our huge age gap and its another long distance again. I’ve been gone tru a 3 failed LDR’s and I was really hoping it’s not gonna be the same with him.
I love him so much because he can totally and openly tells me on how he adores me even I have some flaws that I don’t also like about myself. 
We we’re really inlove, he’s the first one to to tell me the words “I love you” and I also felt it too after he asked me to be his girl. We were happy and constantly communicating and talking about anything until one day, his phone locked up and we weren’t able to communicate regularly. We added each other on our social media account such as Facebook and that’s why even without the regular iMessage somehow he can still send me some messages. And that happened for 2 weeks until he finally got a new phone for himself and I thought we can talk again the same or regularly but it doesn’t happen. 

He’s a nursing student at California and on his 2nd year and also working in a Retired home for elderly while I’m working as a registered nurse here in my home country which is the Philippines in a private hospital. We plan to meet next year on person on this coming February.

He told me last time he’s always tired from work a lot and only have one day off per week and that’s why I let him socialize and have fun with his friends, he asked my permission first and I let him do it because he likes to have fun too once in a while. But then that affected our relationship, when he’s working, he can’t hardly look at his phone to see if I have a text or message and he will only answer after like a half day or 8-12 hours. I think the difference was I’m more free to check my phone for messages even I’m also busy at work. But he always apologize to me and told me he’s afraid to lose me and promise to make me as his priority, and we even planned to talk on FaceTime every other day but still failed. I always feel dissapointed or sometimes mad whenever he promises me to call me once he’s home after work or hanging out with his friends but once he’s home, he zoned out and forget to call me. And that happened lots of times. 

We’re only dating for a month and 1 week right now. Earlier he told me about him being depressed that’s why sometimes he’s being distant or he purposely ignoring my calls or messages because he said he needs time before he can answer my questions or messages. He told me he’s not happy about his life or his situation right now and he looks so sad while we’re in video call. I felt bad about it. He told me too before that we met on the wrong time, I think he’s been dealing about his depression for a long time now. He’s been already with two failed LDR’s that lasts years too but they cheated on him. And same situation with my past LDR’s, one cheated and two had no time for me. We had both trust issues . And so I was telling him a about what I feel whenever he stood me up or when he avoids to talk to me. And he apologize to me always after. He said I don’t deserve it. I kinda threatened him that I might get tired and leave if he won’t give me time because it’s like the same with the last guy I dated. 

In the back of my mind, we might not last long too because if he always do the same thing over and over of him ignoring me when he’s depressed, I don’t know how to deal with it but now I should know how. I don’t want us to be apart, I felt sad when he said too that he’s never ever gonna break up with me but maybe I’ll be the one who’s gonna break up with him when I get tired of him.

I’m feeling kinda loss because I love him so much and I want to let him know I’m here for him always but when he’s depressed I don’t know what to do or say to him.  Because I might be insensitive and not think about his feelings. That’s why whenever I insist or initiate conversation first with him, he doesn’t respond recently or lately. And that’s because he’s feeling depressed.

He told me too before that we met on the wrong time, I think he’s been dealing about his depression for a long time now. He’s been already with two failed LDR’s that lasts years too but they cheated on him. And same situation with my past LDR’s, one cheated and two had no time for me. We had both trust issues . And so I was telling him a about what I feel whenever he stood me up or when he avoids to talk to me. And he apologize to me always after. He said I don’t deserve it. I kinda threatened him that I might get tired and leave if he won’t give me time because it’s like the same with the last guy I dated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the back of my mind, we might not last long too because if he always do the same thing over and over of him ignoring me when he’s depressed, I don’t know how to deal with it but now I should know how. I don’t want us to be apart, I felt sad when he said too that he’s never ever gonna break up with me but maybe I’ll be the one who’s gonna break up with him when I get tired of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling kinda loss because I love him so much and I want to let him know I’m here for him always but when he’s depressed I don’t know what to do or say to him.  Because I might be insensitive and not think about his feelings. That’s why whenever I insist or initiate conversation first with him, he doesn’t respond recently or lately. And that’s because he’s feeling depressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever dated someone who has depression too? How did you deal with it and how did you help your partner when he’s having episodes of it? 
We both want us to work that’s why I don’t want to give easily just because he’s depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"I(20F) met a guy(20M) who is super sweet and has probably the best smile on Earth. We had class together along with a group project so I didn't do anything about my crush because I didn't not want to upset the balance in our group.

During one of our group meetings, we were taking a break or something. I stood at the window and just looked outside, because sometimes you just need to stop for a second and appreciate the world around you. I felt something brush against my shoulder and he was there, even though there was an entire wall of windows. I can't lie and say that was nothing to me, because even if he was just being friendly, having someone right there meant everything to me.

Due to the project he started sitting next to me in class. I learned he loved skyline photos and showed me a bunch of his own that he took. I wasn't expecting this, but it was nice. Then the week finally came, and we had to present our project. We performed, and we all weren't bad at all. I gelled my hair back because I was performing as a man, and I word vomited about doing hair in a masculine style to him. He took it pretty well.

Over Thanksgiving I decided that when we came back for our final class, I would give him my number. With that, and two other big presentations for work and school within the next 2 days, I was a nervous wreck. That morning, I wrote my number on a purple note card, with with my name and a smiley face on the bottom. I carried it with me until finally the class begun. I was there extremely early as I always am because I don't want something to happen resulting in me being late, and say at my normal spot in the front of the classroom. He came in late so he lurked in the back.

At the end of class, our TA left the room as we did a survey. He got done extremely fast and I resigned my fate there. I finished up, turned it in, and began to walk out of the class when I see him talking with one of our other group mates. Ok, no big deal, I'll just slide past them so I can actually get out the door and mourn my inability to do the one thing I really wanted to do.

I get out the door and walk maybe two steps when I hear him call out my name. I turn around, confused, when he asked me if I wanted to see the final version of the production book he had to make. I said sure, so we stood side by side looking at his computer as he explained that he had forgotten to do something and couldn't bring himself to do it until the last moment. I knew the feeling all too well.

A couple of my other friends from class came up and were talking, and seeing as we were done with our discussion, I joined them. Besides, I figured he probably wouldn't want an audience watching a girl like me give a guy like him their phone number. So, we talk and are scandalized by an old photo of our university, and his interest peeks and he comes over and starts talking with us. A few minutes later, we we're all walking out the door together, joking around. 

We get down the stairs and I normally stay and chat for a few minutes with my two friends, because this is the only time I see them. So I start talking to one of them and noticed him starting to leave, so I went over and called for him. He turned around and asks if I want a hug.

I was so confused, jumbled up my words, but eventually said yes and gave him a hug.

While we we standing there I grab the note card and thrust it into his hands, telling him to call me. I then immediately turn around and drag my one friend to the opposite door as I just basically malfunctioned and went into fight or flight mode. We get to the other door and she stops me and looks over my shoulder. She says he had literally just been staring at us through my fleeing of the situation, but he had just left.

,dating_advice,"TLDR: Girl A and I have been seeing each other for a couple of weeks. We haven't brought up exclusivity, but we are very close and incredibly connected. Had sex with this other girl B and now I feel guilty.

Sorry if this has been asked a million times before.

I met this girl (call her A) a couple of weeks ago on a dating app. Our chemistry is insane. Never felt such a strong connection from the get-go. Really want to see where this one goes. We've been enjoying the greatest times together, and keep in touch regularly. It feels right and I'm very happy with the current state of affairs. I'm thinking that we'll progress towards bigger and better things sooner rather than later.

We have consciously decided to go with the flow, being especially cautious due to the nature of our electrifying connection. We want to make sure this not some crazy dream and we are actually just meant to be together. We haven't defined the relationship or talked about exclusivity, our dating profiles are still up, etc. It's kind of a don't ask, don't tell situation so far. I feel like we are both practical and focused on the most important thing at the end of the day: our connection. At this point though, I think we're in a relationship-ey place: we hold hands, we say cutesy things to each other, we talk about future plans, etc. Slowly but surely.

Now... enter this other girl (call her B). Also met her recently, she's attractive and fun to be around. A fine person overall, but absolutely no match for girl A in my books. We were hanging out a couple of days ago and ended up at mine. I felt kinda hesitant but she was really into me, blah blah -- hormones got the best of me and you know what happened next. It was alright, nothing groundbreaking. I was honest with B that I'm seeing A and it might go somewhere, etc. I don't think there's an issue on that end.

My problem is that I feel like I somehow betrayed A's trust. I have expressed to her how taken I am by her and from the bottom of my heart, it's all true. In terms of our arrangement, there is no commitment whatsoever yet -- none of this would have happened if that was the case. I can't help but feel like a bit of an asshole though. I cannot turn back time, so not doing what I did is not a solution to my uncomfortable feelings. I don't believe telling her is a good idea because nothing productive could come out of it IMO. If I was in her shoes, I'd rather not know because even if what I did is not morally wrong, it's unpleasant and unnecessary information. 

I kinda regret what happened because it doesn't feel great right now, but from a practical POV, I know my heart is in the right place. I truly want to make girl A happy. I'm falling for this girl; staying active in the dating scene has been further confirmation that she's the real deal for me. I'm thinking of being explicit about exclusivity very soon, so I can concentrate my energy on this amazing person.

Additionally, I heard a quiet “Hi” behind me as I was leaving class which might have been her trying to talk to me? I wasn’t sure if it was directed towards me or the professor and was in a hurry to get to my next class so I didn’t turn around unfortunately.

I wasn’t sure if it was directed towards me or the professor and was in a hurry to get to my next class so I didn’t turn around unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that was probably a mistake and am now regretting my actions. So I would like to try and talk to her and maybe get her number or something next class (Tuesday, which is also the last class of the semester) and was wondering what would be a good way to approach to this? I don’t really know much about German women so I would appreciate if anyone has any tips for me! Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been dating my boyfriend (23/M) for almost 9 months now. He loves me (21/F) and I love him too.

For context: I'm 22F, he is 28M, i have been an out lesbian for the past 3 years, called myself pansexual as a teen, knew this man when i was 14, and he was simply the older brother of my first boyfriend, then at 19 in 2015, we stopped talking, i am now 22F (23 in a month), he is 28M.

I think i might be bi, rather than a lesbian, as after reflecting for the past year, all of my MAJOR crushes have been on men, including a kid in primary school, 2 teachers in high school, a team leader now at work, a couple internet personalities, 28M guy in this story and the occasional man on the street.

I had brushed a lot of these off as just having admiration for these men, and as for the teacher, my aunt who is 10 or so years older liked him too, so i figured it was a genetic thing. 

 I still find women aesthetically pleasing, and i have dated one, and i still have crushes, but they're usually fleeting, not as strong, and while i can see myself spending my life with a woman or man, i find it easier to imagine being intimate with a man.
I've labelled myself a lesbian for years, and trying out bisexuality fits me too, i think.

Enter 28M, after 4 years of not talking, he has re entered the picture, and he is clearly still attracted to and interested in me. He is very forward with his feelings, which is nice, rather than having to be unsure of his feelings, and he has stated if i was bi or straight he would very happily date me. I am also interested in him, if only mildly for now. Its been years since ive seen or spoken to him, and I want to see him in person again to suss out my feelings.

I haven't told him i am reevaluating my sexuality, because i was a little concerned if i was wrong, what if i lead him on? I don't want to hurt his feelings if i tell him in bi, if im wrong.

I spoke to a friend in person who was excited for me, and she said i should tell him about it over message, so he can read and process it, before responding, or not. Last message i sent was asking about a burger dinner, which i didnt get a reply to. I'll leave it at LEAST 48 hours before i send another message, but i want to know what to say. Do i tell him in person after i see him, via message...?

The only other complication is that after looking on his Facebook profile, it looks like he is in a relationship. I kind of want to tell him, but tell him i refuse to be the other woman, and he can't dump his current girlfriend for me. I'm not sure if that would make me a bad person though. 

I just really need some advice on what to do, cause im stuck. I want to tell him in person, but from his perspective, being told via message might be nicer, i want to try dating him, but i dont want to be the cause of a breakup...

In late August this year, I started seeing this girl who I met on a dating site. After a couple of dates we soon learned that we had a lot in common (we both liked the same music, we liked going to the theatre, we read the same books growing up etc) and it felt like we “clicked” with each other. Over the months it felt like we were getting closer and closer by the day so I decided to ask if we could be exclusive (at this point she had stayed the night at mine). The response I got from her was that she was unsure if she wanted a boyfriend or not and that she had to think about it. A week later she asks to meet up and that she’s been doing a lot of thinking. When we meet up she tells me that she just wants to be friends as she has a lot going on in her life and she thought it would be unfair dragging me into it.

We still meet up and talk over text quite often. The problem is that I started developing feelings for her while we were dating and it’s hurting me inside knowing that we are nothing more than friends after the all the memories we shared. I want to be there for her  and support her but every time I see her I hurt inside and I just cannot ignore it.

I have asked her to meet up next weekend with the intention to tell her how I feel and that I’m finding it hard to be “just friends”. 

Am I doing the right thing? 

I thought it would be a good idea to get an outside perspective on this.

,dating_advice,"So I’ve (21M) met this really wonderful girl (19F) through work. We hit it off for about a month at work where we were just friends but clearly interested (none showed anything but both kinda ”knew”).

We met outside work first time last week, since I had just quit, and had drinks and had a really good time. We had talked before about going to her place instead in case the weather got too bad but we did go to hers anyway after the bar. Both a little tipsy walking through the city in the rain, it was amazing. Movie-like.

 Anyway once we got to her place we had a drink and watched some netflix until we eventually paused, stared into each others eyes and kissed. It was great, except for one thing.. She didn’t really know how to kiss. It got a little uncomfortable for me so I kinda stopped but it was nice nevertheless.

I asked about her experience (in a nice way, not immediately after kissing her) and she told me she’s never had any guy, literally no experience apart from maybe making out with someone drunk ONCE. That’s it. Sooo I’m not sure what to do here? I genuinely like her, but I’m not sure how to escalate further if she’s inexperienced?

We met again last night after a after-work party which I attended to meet my old coworkers again. It ended with me going back to her place to wait for a bus so I stayed for about 2 hours.
We watched some stupid videos and then talked about everything with my arms around her. I didn’t try to makeout with her this time because I was trying to avoid any awkwardness since she probably also is aware she’s not a ”good kisser”.
But we kissed before I left and everything felt good.

 The thing is though, things have to escalate sooner or later, and probably by the next time we see each other. I want to kiss her with passion and make out. I have no problem taking it slow for her but I’m just curious to HOW this would play out? I’m afraid to initiate anything sexual if she’s insecure and inexperienced?

She recently broke up with somebody who was cheating on her 5months ago (started dating me the week of her breakup cause she said she wasn’t emotionally attached to him anymore) So I run into this issue with her it’s extremely annoying to me, I have friends Guy and girl friends who I treat equally and the same share hobbies and what not equally and treat them literally the same way. It slightly irritates me That anytime it’s a girl (friend) I’m talking or having fun with there is questions for day about them and not of the male friends I think it’s maybe just a jealousy thing so I let it slide. But today It was difffent she asked if she could see one of my girl(friends) photos on Facebook cause I was talking to them about something. So I went to the photos to show her after she looked she then left and went to my messages with her. I have nothing to hide so at first I thought nothing of it then I thought Hey wait a sec I have her my phone for one thing and she’s doing something else! So I asked her for my phone back since she’s not doing what I have it to her for and if she wants to see my messages she can ask me permission first and then she started cursing at me and telling me “back away stop trying to snatch my phone what am I trying to hide?” I’m stunned cause it’s like I have nothing to hide but I don’t appreciate you going threw my private messages without my permission AND doing it under the pretense of you trying to find something “bad”.  Cause it seems like you don’t have trust in me. I also have a issue with anytime she gets angry or yell she breaks stuff and destroys her stuff and won’t listen to reason. And if something makes her mad she shuts down on it. A example would be I tell her to check a magazine subscription I use sometimes. I’ll tell her exactly what to do, she will do it they would email her something is wrong and needs to fix it she would fix it but misread something. Weeks go by I notice something’s up because I have the same subscription and it don’t take long I tell her to check to see if they emailed her something she would tell me she checked and they asked for the same information she “already gave” them I’m like okay. Weeks later I get mine and she doesn’t get hers, she would call it stupid, dumb a waste of her time, trash and a horrible service. But when I look in her email they ask for her information cause she forgot to add apartment number or zip code and I told her to check and she’s just say whatever she don’t want to do it and stuff like that frustrates me what can I do to help situations like this or calm myself cause what I normally do is leave the area because I don’t want to blow up and lose my temper but in me leaving causes her more stress cause then she says or I’m leaving her and am I going to leave her every time I’m upset and I’m not a good boyfriend it’s like no way I can win. 

Another Recent example is that She likes to smoke. I hate smoke, but I accept her for who she is and what she does. I was trying to explain a board game to them and they started smoking and getting high asking me to repeat basic stuff I told them 7 times already and doing stuff that’s distracting like throwing dice which I got upset and fed up with, but I kept going getting at least basic  information threw before I told them let’s call it’s quits cause they to high to play and I’m already stressed. I’m mad about the ordeal but I’ll get over it cause I did the basic at least. She tells me it’s who she is I shouldn’t get mad. I told her it’s fine Just if she’s about to play a game with me and I have to explain something to her I’d appreciate her not smoking while I’m doing it then her and her friend go off on me about me not accept them for smoking and I’m arrogant because I don’t like smoking and I think I know what it does to a person and I need to date a job smoker if ima be judgmental. And I’m like woah All I’m saying is if your going to smoke then I don’t want to waste my time explaining till your not high and compared it to not getting in a car with somebody who regularly drinks because I don’t want to risk getting into a accident cause they are drunk. And they kept saying my comparisons are bad and I’m so judgmental it’s making me feel like throwing up :(

But when I look in her email they ask for her information cause she forgot to add apartment number or zip code and I told her to check and she’s just say whatever she don’t want to do it and stuff like that frustrates me what can I do to help situations like this or calm myself cause what I normally do is leave the area because I don’t want to blow up and lose my temper but in me leaving causes her more stress cause then she says or I’m leaving her and am I going to leave her every time I’m upset and I’m not a good boyfriend it’s like no way I can win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Recent example is that She likes to smoke. I hate smoke, but I accept her for who she is and what she does. I was trying to explain a board game to them and they started smoking and getting high asking me to repeat basic stuff I told them 7 times already and doing stuff that’s distracting like throwing dice which I got upset and fed up with, but I kept going getting at least basic  information threw before I told them let’s call it’s quits cause they to high to play and I’m already stressed. I’m mad about the ordeal but I’ll get over it cause I did the basic at least. She tells me it’s who she is I shouldn’t get mad. I told her it’s fine Just if she’s about to play a game with me and I have to explain something to her I’d appreciate her not smoking while I’m doing it then her and her friend go off on me about me not accept them for smoking and I’m arrogant because I don’t like smoking and I think I know what it does to a person and I need to date a job smoker if ima be judgmental. And I’m like woah All I’m saying is if your going to smoke then I don’t want to waste my time explaining till your not high and compared it to not getting in a car with somebody who regularly drinks because I don’t want to risk getting into a accident cause they are drunk. And they kept saying my comparisons are bad and I’m so judgmental it’s making me feel like throwing up :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I try to talk to her about when I see her react to stuff or do certain things that can easily be avoided I always get hit with “Stop analyzing me I hate being analyzed”&lt;/p&gt;

 I(19F) can’t wrap my head around why I’m basically “obsessed” for this guy(18M) when I don’t even know him. He’s really tall with a great complexion, has this annoyingly cute eye twitch he does when he’s annoyed, is quiet and gentle, but not sensitive or shy. I know surface level things about his personality, but not enough to say I like him. Yet, he’s stuck in my head and that baffles me. 

Last year we used to be together-ish unofficially/in the dating stage. Hence, I don’t know him too well as our time together was very short before we drifted; I didn’t want a relationship then so I sabotaged it.

I never deleted his number however and I also never contacted him again after leaving him on read since he said he needed some time and space.

Only problem I face is the vicious biological need to reproduce...

Sadly, I absolutely love the female body and the immense power and connection two can have with each other.

I love cooking together, snuggin' together on the couch under a warm blanket, you name it.

I don't **ever** want to feel this need to reproduce or be in a relationship again.  Is there anything I can do to remove this desire besides suffering and staying disciplined?  I don't need a relationship nor do I need to reproduce. I'd like be able to ignore women entirely and turn them down without regret.  I thought being tossed aside by my ex like a used rag would suffice, but it hasn't.

In two years time, I'll have a debt free masters and will be 29 years old.  I'll be able to venture the world, do everything I've ever wanted and pursue a career I absolutely love.

I love the special bond, I love the small things two can do for each other and especially love the idea of being a father and a loving husband.  I love cooking together, snuggin&amp;#39; together on the couch under a warm blanket, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is all a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;issue for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; want to feel this need to reproduce or be in a relationship again.  Is there anything I can do to remove this desire besides suffering and staying disciplined?  I don&amp;#39;t need a relationship nor do I need to reproduce. I&amp;#39;d like be able to ignore women entirely and turn them down without regret.  I thought being tossed aside by my ex like a used rag would suffice, but it hasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In two years time, I&amp;#39;ll have a debt free masters and will be 29 years old.  I&amp;#39;ll be able to venture the world, do everything I&amp;#39;ve ever wanted and pursue a career I absolutely love.  I&amp;#39;m in excellent health, I have a great body, great personality and despite a recent breakup, my self-worth being single outweighs the dread of this breakup or ever being in a relationship again.  I love being around myself and am really excited for my future minus the instinctive desire for an relationship or something physical.&lt;/p&gt;

I can tell he’s not looking for hook ups or “games”, and I think it’s due to the fact that he’s older and has a kid? 

And I’m also not looking for a fling either.

I’ve been excited talking to him as he’s really cute and sweet but as soon as he told me about the kid, I got a pit in my stomach. And it hasn’t left, and I would say I’m super open minded as well. He asked if it was a dealbreaker and I said no, and went on to ask about the kid.

I was being polite and also just trying to come to terms with what that means and how I feel about it. 

I have never really wanted kids, in my last relationship we didn’t want them but we eventually grew fond of the idea of having a kid of our own one day.

I've been seeing this really hot girl casually for a month now, basically all of our dates are just netlflix and chill, except for one which was a double date which again ended in sex. We have never talked about what we are so I have been casually seeing other people as well.

I thought I'd set up a cute Christmas date, bake cookies, and put on her favorite Christmas movie. The plan was to just cuddle and hang out, and then at the end I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend. But, things quickly transitioned to the bedroom at her insinuation. We have amazing sexual chemistry, and she said that today was the first time a partner has ever made her come from oral. All of this is awesome, except I want her to be my girlfriend.

How do I like get her to understand I actually like her as a person? I've had a FWB before, and it's a completely different situation than with this girl.

Like, I’d flirt with her over text or compliment her, and she’d say “aw thanks” or something like “thank you :)”.  Like, she has some WILLLLLLD anxiety, but I don’t know if that’s the cause of how she texts. I’m not happy right now. At all. My finals are piling the heck up. I’ve asked for advice from a couple people. 

My siblings said that I’m being impatient, and that I need to calm down and wait for her. And that a girl like her is looking for a long term relationship.

One of my friends outright told me that I’m trying to rush myself into something that I’m not going to be happy about in the long run, and that it’ll make things complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

My Ex of 6 years and I split up about 3 months ago, we didn't have a huge fight or something, we just agreed that we are not compatible for a life together and stayed friends. About a month ago we started to have sex with each other again because both of us miss that part, but agreed that this is just physical, we both don't want to get back together and we will stop as soon as one of us is about to get into a serious relationship again. Now, I've reconnected with a girl I went to school with and even though we only met up a few times as of right now, I feel like she might be interested in more than just going out for drinks and talking about the old times.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this is far from being anything serious I'm not going to end my FWB-situation with my Ex, but I keep thinking about how and how much I should tell this girl in case it get's more serious and she asks about my past relationships, how long I've been single, when I had sex for the last time etc. Normally I feel like being completly open and honest is the best way to build trust, but I'm worried that she might think I'm not really over my Ex yet and keep her around because I still got feelings for her or that she get's put of because a) it's my Ex and b) we've been together for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

So what would you do?

,dating_advice,"I understand that this is sub for dating advice so I hope it's okay to ask this question even though it's extremely ironic.

Anyway, I remember joining this sub back when I was 19, and now I'm 22. Back then I remember wanting a relationship. I really wanted the love and support of a partner more than anything else. I truly thought that was what would make me happy

But now I'm beginning to have serious thoughts that maybe that's not where my happiness lays.

To further elaborate, lately, in the last few months, I've seen friends and relatives lose their relationships. Some of those relationships were just casual ones, some were a bit more committed with children and engagement rings involved.

To have seen how a break up can have a devastating effect on one... It's terrifying. It's made me realize that while it's true that a relationship can greatly enhance your life, it has the power to shatter you as well. And I'm unsure if I have the strength to allow myself to be that vulnerable to someone.

It's not just the fear of heartbreaks that has turned me off from relationships but also the fact that I'm used to doing things on my own now. Before I thought I was a loser for going to the movies alone or for eating alone at a restaurant but now it feels weird to NOT be alone.

For example, a few weeks ago I invited a close friend,who happens to be of the opposite sex, to hang out and go shopping together and the whole time I felt very awkward. I know that's they're not my significant other nor do I have feelings for them but for a moment I imagined what if this was a date and it made me uncomfortable just thinking about it. I'm so used to shopping by myself that having someone to slow down my pace for and the need to hold a conversation for the entire trip made me feel exhausted in the end.

It's not just that but when I go on actual dates, I no longer feel excitement. I no longer hope for second dates. I no longer desire anyone as a romantic partner.

I think I've realized that I was never meant to be romantically involved with anyone. It just feels very off to me. 

In short, being with someone makes me feel not so much like myself, I refuse to let someone have the ability to hurt me by deciding they no longer wish to be with me, and I no longer desire to even try to find someone.

I'm unsure if this sounds like defeat or maybe me just deciding I want something else for myself in life and knowing my own limitations when it comes to personal relationships.

EDIT: Sorry if this is on the wrong sub reddit. I'm new here!

I was 18 fresh out of high school when I started my first job. A few months later we get a couple of new employees, one of which is a was a dude that became my best friend soon after. One of the other new hires was a girl that I instantly ""Clicked"" with. The three of use started hanging out outside of work pretty much everyday having an amazing summer.

Fast forward a year and I start getting feelings for this girl. I started dropping hints here and there to see some kind of reaction. Eventually I came out and just said it and got shot down. She was fresh out of a relationship and didn't want anything. A few months later my friend, knowing that I had a thing for her a while ago, out of nowhere asked me if he can ask here out. I told him yea sure why not, not realizing that he was being serious. Eventually that lead to a relationship that started the weirdest three years of my life. Since we where all still best friends I watched this all transpire and got resentful towards him and distanced myself.

About another year goes by, we weren't that close anymore until one day I got into a serious accident. Caught some gravel and wrecked my bike into a guard rail. I broke my back and shattered my elbow (I got lucky and made a full recovery with a few metal additions to my arm). Woke up from a short coma to them standing in my hospital room alongside my family. Somehow that drove us back together and we continued our weird friendship for another two years.

This brings me to the present. She broke up with him and a week later he fked her childhood friend. I was left to pick up the pieces. Needless to say I am no longer friends with him for what he did. There she was single for the first time since 17 so she took full advantage of that and caught up for lost time. The usual partying, getting wasted, etc. The last few months she started acting differently towards me. A lot more touchy and affectionate. Always stealing my phone and taking a bunch of selfies of us, changing in front of me, helping her zip up her dress, etc. A few weeks ago we went to the beach with a bunch of my friends and her friends. We ended up cuddling and falling asleep with the only blanked she brought by the fire pit. Some might dismiss this as ""just things you do with your best friend"" but keep in mind this is someone that doesn't really like physical contact with anyone ever.

Now here I am really confused and questioning everything. In love with my best friend for over 5 years and not knowing what to do with myself anymore. I like hanging out with her and I hate it at the same time.

,dating_advice,"I 25/m had a second date with this girl 25/F that I met on Bumble last Saturday and it went fantastically well. 

Originally we had planned to meet at a coffee shop at like 1:30 in the afternoon on Saturday, but then I found out that she was actually planning on cutting a trip to Lansing (like an hour and a half a way from where we live) short just to meet me in time. Once I found out, we rescheduled to meet at a bar later that night instead so that she would have more time in Lansing. I feel like the fact that she was willing to make an hour and a half drive back to see me early was a pretty strong IOI?

We didn't hook up or anything like that after the date but we met at a bar and played pool and hung out and talked for like 3.5 hour straight and it literally felt like I could have talked to her all night. I've never had this good of chemistry with someone who I've met through a dating app. It was awesome.

Afterwards when we were talking in the parking lot she made it clear that she wants to keep seeing me, but unfortunately she is out of town visiting her family through the end of the year. Completely unprompted she said something like ""the timing of all of this is really unfortunate, but I'm not going to be able to see you again until the new year. Now that we know that we live in the same apartment complex this should be alot easier"" (We discovered by complete coincidence that we live in the same apartment complex lol.).

I went home feeling fantastic, and went ahead and texted her the following morning just to make sure that she knew my interests/intentions. I said something along the lines of ""I've never connected this well with someone who I've met through a dating app and definitely want to keep seeing you"". I feel like this was kindof a risky text to send someone, but I didn't get a response until like 9 hours later .... and we've been continuing to text but it feels like I usually reply within in hour and she almost always replies at the end of the day.

Is this something that I should be worried about? In person it feels like she has always communicated really strong interest, both the first and second dates went extremely well, but maybe she's just a bad texter?

I feel like this was kindof a risky text to send someone, but I didn&amp;#39;t get a response until like 9 hours later .... and we&amp;#39;ve been continuing to text but it feels like I usually reply within in hour and she almost always replies at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this something that I should be worried about? In person it feels like she has always communicated really strong interest, both the first and second dates went extremely well, but maybe she&amp;#39;s just a bad texter? When we first started chatting it felt like she would text back within one or two hours consistently but since we&amp;#39;ve started actually dating it seems like shes gotten progressively slower, but maybe I&amp;#39;m just being paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;

,dating_advice,"Backstory: I dated a guy for about 11 months (this month would have made it a year.) Our relationship was mostly long distance since neither of us had a car and we went to colleges about an hour and a half away from each other. He did come down here to see me one time during a football game but it was a disaster. He showed up an hour late, he acted distant/cold to me, he pretty much ignored me and only talked to his family while we were there. He explained that he didn't let his family know we were dating because he ""doesn't like to share personal info with his family"". (he brought them to the game because his mom wanted to visit since his sister goes to my school)

I broke up with him a few days later. I realized that I didn't want to be treated this way and that I didn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore. 

Anyway, throughout our whole relationship it's almost always been him that showered me with affection via text. He helped me with my anxiety and depression some too. I always feel uncomfortable with the phrase ""I love you"" since I think you should only say it when you're super serious and you really mean it. About 5 months or so into our relationship he started telling me he loved me. I was uncomfortable and I never said it back because I didn't want to lie. I did like him but never really told him I loved him until about the 9-10 month mark on our relationship. After I broke it off I didn't feel sad or heartbroken, just slightly disappointed that it didn't work out. I didn't cry or try to get him to come back or anything. (Although he was absolutely devastated). Am I a terrible person for not feeling bad about breaking it off? At this point I honestly considered that maybe I'm not the kind of person who can fall in love. Maybe I'm just meant to be alone.

,dating_advice,"The other night I went to a gay bar and I was having a good time dancing and singing with friends and strangers.

At some point during the night, a man placed his arm around my shoulder and we were singing to whatever song that was being played. It's fun to vibe with people over music so I didn't mind that at all!

I went back to see my friends when it was over. As I walked back the same guy high fived me and later said ""Let me slap your ass!"" I told him I didn't roll that way and he still proceeded to slap my ass. I told him to back off and he just replied back ""I would have just taken it"". Now, maybe I was ""signalling"" to other people that I was gay (I'm not) because I was wearing a pink sweater but that's still no reason to just throw yourself at someone and assume that all your advances will be received well. I wore pink because I like pink.

Later during the night, another song I like was being played and I went back to the stage to dance. This man, once again,  came up to the stage and forcefully tried to dance with me. I shoved him away. He proceeded to try and dance with someone else.

Now, at no point was I scared during the night. I'm a rather fit guy and I'm pretty sure protecting myself against this man would not have been too difficult. I was mostly just annoyed but I probably would have gotten really angry had this man kept on going with his advances.

I hated the ass slap, I hated the fact he forcefully tried to get me to dance with him and I hated his dismissive attitude towards the boundaries I tried to set up. As I went home, I just wondered ""Shit, imagine what women have to go through"". While I only felt a short instance of annoyance and frustration, many ladies have to put up with something like this on a consistent basis and there's easily a huge ordeal of shame, humiliation, fear and anger.

I'm not really a feminist type of person, but after this experience, it really opened up to me to many issues you ladies are facing. I know this guy in my story is probably in the minority, but we still have to do better.

I have done things to women that have been received negatively and that have caused awkward situations in the past and I probably still do to some extent today (although I think I've improved a little, haha). I don't really know how to end this post. Reading signs is difficult. Knowing when something will be received well is almost always a gamble. Some people will be OK with certain things and others may not. I guess my only advice is to think a few more seconds before you act and if someone is not OK with a certain advance do not be dismissive. Learn from them and keep improving.

Edit:  
Wow this blew up. The thread is lock and I think it is maybe for the best. This sparked a lot of conversation and debate and while I think there has been a lot of constructive discussions, there has also been a lot of backlash from many people (and that is also fine and I encourage people to point out the flaws in my ideas or opinions). Perhaps I should have phrased certain things better, as I feel as this thread has been a conduit for people to throw gross generalization about many different groups of people. That was not my intention.

I did not mean to characterize homosexuals as predatory, I did not mean to belittle or dismiss women's experience by saying my experience was more important or traumatic than theirs and ultimately I think consent is just something that everyone needs to work on and talk about more (all genders and orientations).

At the end of the day, this is just a personal experience I have gone through and have felt that I have learned from. I felt that sharing might help some people with their dating lives and just in their general lives overall. I hope it has given you something to reflect about a little more.

,dating_advice,"Hi everyone, 

First off, I wanna say how much reddit has helped me in general with getting over bad breakups and regaining my confidence and self esteem. Reading other people’s posts and realizing that you’re not alone in your struggles really helps establish a sense of belonging and getting over your own personal hurdles as well. And with t hat, I need your guys’s advice on something. 

A few months ago, I had shattered my phone and I went to the Apple Store to try to replace it. I thought that I had insurance to cover the damage but I didn’t.

I met this girl a year ago, we live in different towns, but we talk a lot. I always had strong feeling for her but she rejected me. I decided to stay friends because she is a very close friends and I want her in my life no matter what, however hard it can be for me at times when we talk about other guys in her life with me.

Last weekend she started behind strange, very out of character, she told me she was sad but would not tell me why. 
The Sunday of that same weekend I went on a date with a great girl I met online, and I told her about it.
Once the date ended she asked me how it went, and I said great ! She told me she was very happy about it.
I asked her about her day, she told me it was good but at the same time horrible (would not tell me why).
She then added that she was waiting to hear how my day went and that now that she knew she could go to sleep and we left things like that.

The way that conversation went was very out of character for her, and there definitely was something more to it. And because I tend to overanalyze everything she says I am wondering, is it possible that now that I am trying to move on by seeing other people, she starts regretting letting me go ?

,dating_advice,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

so last Thursday a friend \[f/27\] and I went to a book store which had an event and she also brought a friend of hers. The conversation with her went really smooth and we instantly had a good conversation and it felt like we could talk for many hours more. So we exchanged numbers and had our 2nd (or first? date) yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

This date was also really good in my opinion. We went for coffee to a private roastery and there was never a time where we didn't have anything to talk about. After like 2 1/2 hours of straight talking I suggested that we could go for a walk as well. However, it was way too cold for that, so we took the train back to central station.

She then asked me for the time and when I told her, she said that she will probably take the train even further to work on stuff for university. I asked her if we're gonna meet again and she said sure.

Also, before the date she texted me a lot, and after the date it was only short messages. Again, as she said she had to do stuff for university, so I get that, but it felt kinda bad for me anyway. It just fuled into my insecuirty, so I'm not sure if she just said that to get out of the date or if she really has to do sth. for university, because she didn't say anything regarding this topic before. Anyway, this doesn't matter really much.

&amp;#x200B;

So after that date, I constantly thought about her and I really liked her. So I thought, tomorrow or wednesday I will ask for another date.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm unsure if I should just ask for another date, or tell her, that I really liked the date, think she's smart, fashionable and attractive and want to know if she thinks the same. I mean, we only had one ""real"" date and the other one wasn't a real date, it was just a spontaneous act. It's just, for me, it was that we instantly hit it off. It felt like we knew each other for a much longer time. Everything was so natural with her. It just felt right.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I just don't want to ""scare"" her off, by saying those things after such a short time and am thinking if I should go for another ""normal"" date or if I should tell her how I feel.

,dating_advice,"Many guys over complicate things, work on their pick up lines, try to “trick” women, play games etc. thinking this is the way to women. 

Gentlemen, it’s not, and things are a lot simpler.


Just remember a few things and you will be alright:


* When you approach a woman, say what’s really on your mind. Don’t say what you think she wants to hear. This is where many guys blow it.

* It’s always better set a date on the spot instead of on the phone. If you’re just starting out, there’s a good chance you will say something stupid on the phone and blow it. Just ask her “when are you free to go out?”

* Go out one time a week until she starts reaching out. When she does, set a date and get off the phone.

Note: Asking for advice / also kind of a vent 

So me (19M) and this girl (19F) met off tinder,  and we hit it off in chat immediately.  She deleted tinder shortly after. Unfortunately we go to different schools, so theyres a distance barrier between us. After a week of chatting, I invited her out and we met. I thought it went pretty well. But for the next two weeks, our schedules never really lined up. Were both really busy weekdays so we can only meet on weekends. Now its been about a month since we went on the first date (red flag, ik).

But she still initiates conversation. She says good morning and good night to me. I find it really cute. Its mostly about our lives, and nothing really sexual. She seems like a really shy and introverted girl so I dont think shes into text flirting, unless I was shawn mendes or something. Anyways, ive asked her to hang out 3 times, the first two times her excuses seemed legit and she offered to reschdule, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but when I asked her yesterday, she simply replied im not sure yet, its so goddamn cold (it is 5 degrees where we live) and I hate taking the bus alone.

Just a lazy blow off if ive ever seen one. And then she steered the conversation to something else. I really want to call her out on it, but that would just get me no where, so would going no contact and moving on be the best course of action?

Keep contacting slowly and wait for her to ask me? Its the end of the semester at my school so I don't really have any options that I can just move on to, and especially theres a one month holiday. I also kinda caught feelings for her so its really just a bummer that I might have to cut this off.

,dating_advice,"I have some mental issues, specifically regarding self worth. For years I have very firmly believed that I am unattractive and practically never even tried to flirt with women I found attractive. I don't want to make this post about that but it might provide some perspective. I am in therapy and have made some effort to become more attractive, most noticeably by losing weight.

Now finally, I can believe that I am not universally unattractive. I am however still shy, cautious and just plain incompetent when it comes to flirting and dating. There are just a lot of things that I feel I should have learned a long time ago and the fear of being perceived as ugly and generally unattractive has been displaced by a fear of being perceived as awkward and inexperienced.

Long story short, I want to ask out a longtime friend [31F] of mine. We've been friends for years, neither of us has been in a relationship during that time, neither of us goes out a lot or has any hobbies where one would naturally meet many people to date and we get along as friends really well. I somehow got it into my head that she doesn't find me attractive because *she* certainly would have asked *me* out by now if that were the case. I know how ridiculous that sounds when written out but I used that reasoning to basically preemptively reject myself for years.

I can probably invite my friend over and spend some time with her but I really need some advice about how to approach the subject of relationships and communicate the fact that I would like us to try dating. I am actually not entirely sure about what advice to ask from you people. When I get nervous about a conversation like this I usually try to map and memorize a huge dialog tree about what to say, what the other person could reply and how I would proceed then only to have the person answer in an unexpected manner and have the whole thing collapse.

Sorry for rambling. I am just very very nervous right now.",t2_15p1lm,False,,0,False,I [32M] have never dated anyone and finally feel somewhat ready to try,[],r/dating_advice,False,6,,0,True,t3_e8auxz,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],[],{},,True,,1575931682.0,text,6,,,text,self.dating_advice,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have some mental issues, specifically regarding self worth. For years I have very firmly believed that I am unattractive and practically never even tried to flirt with women I found attractive. I don&amp;#39;t want to make this post about that but it might provide some perspective. I am in therapy and have made some effort to become more attractive, most noticeably by losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now finally, I can believe that I am not universally unattractive. I am however still shy, cautious and just plain incompetent when it comes to flirting and dating. There are just a lot of things that I feel I should have learned a long time ago and the fear of being perceived as ugly and generally unattractive has been displaced by a fear of being perceived as awkward and inexperienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I want to ask out a longtime friend [31F] of mine. We&amp;#39;ve been friends for years, neither of us has been in a relationship during that time, neither of us goes out a lot or has any hobbies where one would naturally meet many people to date and we get along as friends really well. I somehow got it into my head that she doesn&amp;#39;t find me attractive because &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; certainly would have asked &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; out by now if that were the case. I know how ridiculous that sounds when written out but I used that reasoning to basically preemptively reject myself for years.&lt;/p&gt;
